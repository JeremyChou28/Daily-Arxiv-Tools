| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Fusing Narrative Semantics for Financial Volatility Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20699v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial decision-making in dynamic markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 6...</summary><p>The 6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Flow based approach for Dynamic Temporal Causal models with non-Gaussian or Heteroscedastic Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17065v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non-stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be nonGaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non-stationary processes along with non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log-likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non-stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[xTime: Extreme Event Prediction with Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation and Expert Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20651v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare, these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Formalization of a Trustworthy AI for Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20621v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Time Series Forecasting Architectures: A Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05088v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of time series forecasting research has brought many deep learning-based modules in this field. However, despite the increasing amount of new forecasting architectures, it is still unclear if we have leveraged the full potential of these existing modules within a properly designed architecture. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical neural architecture search approach for time series forecasting tasks. With the design of a hierarchical search space, we incorporate many architecture types designed for forecasting tasks and allow for the efficient combination of different forecasting architecture modules. Results on long-term-time-series-forecasting tasks show that our approach can search for lightweight high-performing forecasting architectures across different forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20551v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices. To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering. This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Log Neural Controlled Differential Equations: The Lie Brackets Make a Difference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18512v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vector field of a controlled differential equation (CDE) describes the relationship between a control path and the evolution of a solution path. Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control path, parameterise a CDE's vector field using a neural network, and use the solution path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs, a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating a CDE's solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$ observations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Morpheus: Lightweight RTT Prediction for Performance-Aware Load Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20506v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed applications increasingly demand low end-to-end latency, especially in edge and cloud environments where co-located workloads contend for limited resources. Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into future production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive PCA-Based Outlier Detection for Multi-Feature Time Series in Space Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15846v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing multi-featured time series data is critical for space missions making efficient event detection, potentially onboard, essential for automatic analysis. However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations, while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention. We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and 2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the number of variables increases.</p></details> | 23pages, 3 figures |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Time-series Forecasting with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02844v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynTSBench: Rethinking Temporal Pattern Learning in Deep Learning Models for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20273v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities, which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities; and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types of temporal features.The code is available at https://github.com/TanQitai/SynTSBench</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.</p></details> | version 2.0_fixed |
| **[AssistedDS: Benchmarking How External Domain Knowledge Assists LLMs in Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13992v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems. Our data and code are publicly available here: https://github.com/jeremyxianx/Assisted-DS</p></details> |  |
| **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeX: Shapelet-Driven Post Hoc Explanations for Time Series Classification Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20084v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential, limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 1 figure |

| **[Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20579v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPMStereo: Pick-and-Play Memory Construction for Consistent Dynamic Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20178v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost. To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a `play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation.

We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.</p></details> |  |

First, Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is applied on PMU data from the point of interconnection (POI) of the plants to obtain the finite-dimensional Koopman operator. Then, modal analysis is performed on a reduced-order Koopman operator to extract spatio-temporal patterns. The data-driven eigenvalues and eigenvectors quantify each plant's contribution to critical oscillatory modes without requiring any system model information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through simulated case studies on modified IEEE 39-bus and WECC 179-bus test systems by benchmarking the data-driven results against ground-truth models. Its performance is further validated using PMU data from real oscillation events in the ISO-New England system. This data-driven method offers a practical tool for both planning-stage simulations and post-event analysis of real oscillation events, enabling effective mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures, Journal paper.Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power System</p></details> |

Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found a fundamental error (data leakage) in cross-validation setup affecting both papers.

| **[HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features. In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Discretization Barrier of Continuous Physics Simulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17955v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signature Kernel Scoring Rule as Spatio-Temporal Diagnostic for Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19110v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2 models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training, we train sliding window generative neural networks using a predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.</p></details> |  |

Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.</p></details> |  |

This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.</p></details> |  |

The proposed setup can be used for experiments aimed at controlling spatiotemporal temperature distribution. Temperature control is achieved by impinging coolant fluid jets, leveraging a manifold of channels targeted to the surface. The direction of the fluid is controlled by shifting the role of channels between inputs, outputs, or closing them. Files associated with this work include Computer-Aided Design (CAD) STEP files, Gerber files to manufacture a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) written in Python. We provide a step-by-step guide to assemble the experimental setup. We also provide instructions to interact with the setup through the GUI, which allows for real-time tracking of sample temperature and flow rates per flow control device. Additionally, we provide examples of usage of the setup, including system characterization with step response, Proportional-Integral-Derivative performance tracking, and disturbance rejection in a coupled system. Extending the application is accessible through the files provided in the open repository associated with this work. The active cooling device presents a safe, flexible, and complete design, allowing for lab-scale assessment of the performance of custom temperature control strategies using enclosed impinging jets.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method.

While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Neural Compression of Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10433v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point clouds have gained prominence across numerous applications due to their ability to accurately represent 3D objects and scenes. However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms octree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance in joint geometry and attribute compression.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches for modeling Argo temperature rely on spatial partitioning, where data are locally modeled by first estimating a prescribed mean structure and then fitting Gaussian processes (GPs) to the mean-subtracted anomalies. Such strategies introduce challenges in designing suitable mean structures and defining domain partitions, often resulting in ad hoc modeling choices. In this work, we propose a one-stop Gaussian process regression framework with a generic spatio-temporal covariance function to jointly model Argo temperature data across broad spatial domains. Our fully data-driven approach achieves superior predictive performance compared with methods that require domain partitioning or parametric regression. To ensure scalability over large spatial regions, we employ the Vecchia approximation, which reduces the computational complexity from cubic to quasi-linear in the number of observations while preserving predictive accuracy. Using Argo data from January to March over the years 2007-2016, the same dataset used in prior benchmark studies, we demonstrate that our approach provides a principled, scalable, and interpretable tool for large-scale oceanographic analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.</p></details> |  |

A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data.

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby quadratically reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM keeps the pretrained LLM backbone frozen, yielding faster training and lower memory usage. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

| **[Proactive and Fair Epidemic Resource Allocation Through an Integrated Supply Chain Framework: Insights from a COVID-19 Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16969v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and effective decision-making is critical during epidemics to reduce preventable infections and deaths. This demands integrated models that jointly capture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and behavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic forecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally responsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization framework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine supply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective infection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports coordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two formulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model that leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved mitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable heuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The model is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based forecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models under data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more than 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while significantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions. Our framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with vaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic policies. Fairness improves overall efficiency in the long term by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations, leading to better long-term public health outcomes. The model offers policymakers a scalable and operationally relevant tool to strengthen preparedness and ensure a more effective and equitable response to epidemics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing in the Dark: A Teacher-Student Framework for Dark Video Action Recognition via Knowledge Distillation and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03724v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition in dark or low-light (under-exposed) videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

| **[Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> |  |
| **[T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

| **[EDVD-LLaMA: Explainable Deepfake Video Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16442v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskControl: Spatio-Temporal Control for Masked Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10780v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in motion diffusion models have enabled spatially controllable text-to-motion generation. However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

| **[StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Standardization for improved Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15589v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors. To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traces Propagation: Memory-Efficient and Scalable Forward-Only Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13053v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients. However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning. Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient, scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes. Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way for efficient learning at the edge.</p></details> |  |

We show that STEMMED can be decomposed node-by-node, suggesting a tractable distributed learning procedure. Simulation shows that this learning algorithm can accurately recover known parameters of STEMMED, especially for small networks and long data-horizons. Next, we turn this node-by-node decomposition into an online cooperative multi-period forecasting framework, which is asymptotically robust to operational errors, to facilitate Opioid-related overdose death (OOD) trends forecasting among neighboring communities. In our numerical study, we parameterize STEMMED using individual-level OOD data and county-level demographics in Massachusetts. For any node, we observe that OODs within the same drug class from nearby locations have the greatest influence on future OOD trends. Furthermore, the expected proportion of OODs triggered by historical events varies greatly across counties, ranging between 30%-70%. Finally, in a practical online forecasting setting, STEMMED-based cooperative framework reduces prediction error by 60% on average, compared to well-established forecasting models. Leveraging the growing abundance of public health surveillance data, STEMMED can provide accurate forecasts of local OOD trends and highlight complex interactions between OODs across communities and drug types. Moreover, STEMMED enhances synergies between local and federal government entities, which is critical to designing impactful policy interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT.

Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions. Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures.

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

| **[Macro-Level Correlational Analysis of Mental Disorders: Economy, Education, Society, and Technology Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13780v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper quantifies the age-stratified global burden of four mental disorders in 27 regions from 1990 to 2021 using GBD 2021. To put it in detail, it links the age-standardized years of disability adjustment with 18 world development indicators across economic, educational, social and information technology sectors. Then, by means of Pearson correlation, mutual information, Granger causality and maximum information coefficient and other methods, the linear, nonlinear and lagged dependency relationships were evaluated. After research, it was found that there is a very prominent spatio-temporal heterogeneity among young people aged 20 to 39, and the coupling relationship is stronger. From the overall situation, education corresponds to a low burden. Unemployment corresponds to a high burden. Through lag analysis, it can be known that the influence time of economic and technological factors is relatively short, while that of educational factors is relatively long. These results highlight the macro determinants that play a role at different time scales and also provide population-level references for verifying computational mental health models and for intervention measures in specific regions and for specific ages.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICDM workshop</p></details> |
| **[MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering and Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13702v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models. However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/mvcustom</p></details> |

This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision-focused Sensing and Forecasting for Adaptive and Rapid Flood Response: An Implicit Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16015v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response, yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained disaster response tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

| **[Edit-Your-Interest: Efficient Video Editing via Feature Most-Similar Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13084v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant progress in video editing. However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption. Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns. We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method. Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches. Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention. Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence. Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest. These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity. Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | 32 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tamu-visual-ai.github.io/usplat4d/</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Recognize Correctly Completed Procedure Steps in Egocentric Assembly Videos through Spatio-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12385v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables in the main paper and one figure and table in the appendix.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[RIGNO: A Graph-based framework for robust and accurate operator learning for PDEs on arbitrary domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19205v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary domains is challenging due to the diversity of possible domain shapes, in addition to the often intricate underlying physics. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time. Our code is publicly available at github.com/camlab-ethz/rigno.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection</p></details> |

| **[Open Vocabulary Multi-Label Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09073v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap. On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages (main), 70 pages incl. appendices; figures & tables as in manuscript.

| **[Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, safe and efficient navigation in cluttered environments remains challenging due to partial observability, turbidity, the limited field-of-view of forward-looking sonar (FLS), and occlusions that obscure obstacle geometry. To address these issues, we propose the Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance Strategy (EROAS), a lightweight framework that augments a standard 2D FLS with a pivoting mechanism, effectively transforming it into a cost-efficient \emph{2.5D sonar}. This design provides vertical information on demand, extending situational awareness while minimizing computational overhead. EROAS integrates three complementary modules: first, Sonar Profile-guided Directional Decision Control (SPD2C) for rapid gap detection and generation of reference commands in both horizontal and vertical planes. Secondly, the Spatial Context Generator (SCG), which maintains a short-term obstacle memory of the past to mitigate partial observability, and finally, a Spatio-Temporal Control Barrier Function (ST-CBF) that enforces forward-invariance of safety constraints by filtering nominal references. Together, these components enable robust, reactive avoidance of obstacles in uncertain and cluttered 3D underwater settings. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed EROAS algorithm, demonstrating improved trajectory efficiency, reduced travel time, and enhanced safety compared to conventional methods such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Artificial Potential Fields (APF). https://github.com/AIRLabIISc/EROAS</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PruneGCRN: Minimizing and explaining spatio-temporal problems through node pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10803v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used. These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their most important elements.</p></details> |  |

Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative architectures.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version, work in progress</p></details> |

However, many current models struggle with effectively capturing spatio-temporal dynamics and integrating multiple relational data sources. This study proposes GrifFinNet, a Graph-Relation Integrated Transformer for Financial Predictions, which combines multi-relational graph modeling with Transformer-based temporal encoding. GrifFinNet constructs inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics. Extensive experiments on two Chinese A-share indices show that GrifFinNet consistently outperforms several baseline models and provides valuable, interpretable insights into financial market behavior.

| **[Progressive Scale Convolutional Network for Spatio-Temporal Downscaling of Soil Moisture: A Case Study Over the Tibetan Plateau](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10244v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881, outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3) In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR.

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FCVSR: A Frequency-aware Method for Compressed Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06431v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compressed video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) compressed videos. Recently, some compressed video SR methods attempt to exploit the spatio-temporal information in the frequency domain, showing great promise in super-resolution performance. However, these methods do not differentiate various frequency subbands spatially or capture the temporal frequency dynamics, potentially leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-based compressed video SR model (FCVSR) consisting of a motion-guided adaptive alignment (MGAA) network and a multi-frequency feature refinement (MFFR) module. Additionally, a frequency-aware contrastive loss is proposed for training FCVSR, in order to reconstruct finer spatial details. The proposed model has been evaluated on three public compressed video super-resolution datasets, with results demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to existing works in terms of super-resolution performance (up to a 0.14dB gain in PSNR over the second-best model) and complexity.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |
| **[IONext: Unlocking the Next Era of Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17089v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU), which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry (IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by 10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.</p></details> |  |

| **[Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04910v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.</p></details> |  |

Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |

This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSD-TS: Exploring the Potential of Linear State Space Models for Diffusion Models in Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike most existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for empirical applications even with nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. Furthermore, our method mitigates the distributional bias common among many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. We establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering both linear and nonlinear time series and an analysis on a real-world groundwater dataset, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Functions for Learning Periodic Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09526v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks.

| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |

Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks.

Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension.

| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data.

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics.

| **[Networked Time Series Imputation via Position-aware Graph Enhanced Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18612v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

We demonstrate that SSSD matches or even exceeds state-of-the-art probabilistic imputation and forecasting performance on a broad range of data sets and different missingness scenarios, including the challenging blackout-missing scenarios, where prior approaches failed to provide meaningful results.</p></details> | <details><summary>V3: U...</summary><p>V3: Updated results for the solar dataset. 36 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Time-Series Imputation with Wasserstein Interpolation for Optimal Look-Ahead-Bias and Variance Tradeoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12736v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing time-series data is a prevalent practical problem. Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.</p></details> |  |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[Filling the G_ap_s: Multivariate Time Series Imputation by Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00298v3)** | 2022-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dealing with missing values and incomplete time series is a labor-intensive, tedious, inevitable task when handling data coming from real-world applications. Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502v2)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Data Imputation: A Survey on Deep Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11347v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are all around in real-world applications. However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |
| **[CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09904v2)** | 2019-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications involve multivariate, geo-tagged time series data: at each location, multiple sensors record corresponding measurements. For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-IMM, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Missing: Variable-Aware Representation Learning for Irregular EHR Time Series using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22121v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix Information with History Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01474v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Solar Flare Prediction Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |
| **[ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03310v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures V3: Revised significantly.

While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025). https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34173</p></details> |

In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19341v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |

This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy.

| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08732v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |

Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |

Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learnable Path in Neural Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04333v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs), which are continuous analogues to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are a specialized model in (irregular) time-series processing. In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Time series data types can be broadly classified into regular or irregular. However, there are no existing generative models that show good performance for both types without any model changes. Therefore, we present a general purpose model capable of synthesizing regular and irregular time series data. To our knowledge, we are the first designing a general purpose time series synthesis model, which is one of the most challenging settings for time series synthesis. To this end, we design a generative adversarial network-based method, where many related techniques are carefully integrated into a single framework, ranging from neural ordinary/controlled differential equations to continuous time-flow processes. Our method outperforms all existing methods.</p></details> | NeurIPs 2022 |
| **[EXIT: Extrapolation and Interpolation-based Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Time-series Classification and Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08771v2)** | 2022-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning inspired by differential equations is a recent research trend and has marked the state of the art performance for many machine learning tasks. Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |
| **[Features Fusion Framework for Multimodal Irregular Time-series Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01728v1)** | 2022-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some data from multiple sources can be modeled as multimodal time-series events which have different sampling frequencies, data compositions, temporal relations and characteristics. Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop&Hop: Early Classification of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09795v1)** | 2022-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early classification algorithms help users react faster to their machine learning model's predictions. Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

| **[Modeling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11344v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modeling sequential data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |
| **[Improved Batching Strategy For Irregular Time-Series ODE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05708v1)** | 2022-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series data are prevalent in the real world and are challenging to model with a simple recurrent neural network (RNN). Hence, a model that combines the use of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and RNN was proposed (ODE-RNN) to model irregular time series with higher accuracy, but it suffers from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arm order recognition in multi-armed bandit problem with laser chaos time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13085v1)** | 2020-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By exploiting ultrafast and irregular time series generated by lasers with delayed feedback, we have previously demonstrated a scalable algorithm to solve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems utilizing the time-division multiplexing of laser chaos time series. Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches focus on classification, regression or forecasting tasks on such data.

| **[Discrete-time autoregressive model for unequally spaced time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11158v1)** | 2019-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model (KDM), a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory - a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. KDM achieves highly competitive performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive Latent Diffusion Bridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20819v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

| **[BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e., rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and 43.0\%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Downsizing Diffusion Models for Cardinality Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20681v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the performance of score-based diffusion models in estimating complex text, video, and image distributions with thousands of dimensions, we introduce Accelerated Diffusion Cardest (ADC), the first joint distribution cardinality estimator based on a downsized diffusion model. To calculate the pointwise density value of data distributions, ADC's density estimator uses a formula that evaluates log-likelihood by integrating the score function, a gradient mapping which ADC has learned to efficiently approximate using its lightweight score estimator. To answer ranged queries, ADC's selectivity estimator first predicts their selectivity using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), then uses importance sampling Monte Carlo to correct its predictions with more accurate pointwise density values calculated by the density estimator. ADC+ further trains a decision tree to identify the high-volume, high-selectivity queries that the GMM alone can predict very accurately, in which case it skips the correction phase to prevent Monte Carlo from adding more variance. Doing so lowers median Q-error and cuts per-query latency by 25 percent, making ADC+ usually twice as fast as Naru, arguably the state-of-the-art joint distribution cardinality estimator. Numerical experiments using well-established benchmarks show that on all real-world datasets tested, ADC+ is capable of rivaling Naru and outperforming MSCN, DeepDB, LW-Tree, and LW-NN using around 66 percent their storage space, being at least 3 times as accurate as MSCN on 95th and 99th percentile error. Furthermore, on a synthetic dataset where attributes exhibit complex, multilateral correlations, ADC and ADC+ are considerably robust while almost every other learned model suffered significant accuracy declines. In this case, ADC+ performs better than any other tested model, being 10 times as accurate as Naru on 95th and 99th percentile error.</p></details> |  |

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added new experiments, fixed typos.

However, personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP). Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output. Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy, wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://liulisixin.github.io/EchoDistill-page/</p></details> |

| **[Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11564v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models in modeling discrete categorical data. However, diffusion models that directly work on discrete data space fail to fully exploit the power of iterative refinement, as the signals are lost during transitions between discrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data underperform compared to discrete methods, and the lack of a clear connection between the two approaches hinders the development of effective diffusion models for discrete data. In this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling that incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We establish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold, and building on this analogy, introduce a simple diffusion process that generalizes existing discrete diffusion models. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial symmetry, along with a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the manifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other modalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models and approaches the performance of autoregressive models.

Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model retraining with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.</p></details> |  |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation. Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis. Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.</p></details> | 22 pages,2 figures |

We show analytically and empirically that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps. That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Then, we employ the learned representations to guide the training of a diffusion model for joint optimization over both sequence and structure of antibodies. During the final alignment stage, we optimize the model to favor antibodies with low repulsion and high attraction to the antigen binding site, enhancing the rationality and functionality of the designs. To mitigate conflicting energy preferences, we extend AbDPO (Antibody Direct Preference Optimization) to guide the model toward Pareto optimality under multiple energy-based alignment objectives. Furthermore, we adopt an iterative learning paradigm with temperature scaling, enabling the model to benefit from diverse online datasets without requiring additional data. In practice, our proposed methods achieve high stability and efficiency in producing a better Pareto front of antibody designs compared to top samples generated by baselines and previous alignment techniques. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the superior performance of our methods in generating nature-like antibodies with high binding affinity.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Video Consistency Distance: Enhancing Temporal Consistency for Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Based Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19193v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework. To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance compared to the previous method.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025, 29 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

However, the strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and development in this critical area.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance. To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[EditInfinity: Image Editing with Binary-Quantized Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20217v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential. A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose \emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

| **[Vox-Evaluator: Enhancing Stability and Fidelity for Zero-shot TTS with A Multi-Level Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20210v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models, diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges, manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis. Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism and preference optimization. The demos are shown.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09630v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[IEnSF: Iterative Ensemble Score Filter for Reducing Error in Posterior Score Estimation in Nonlinear Data Assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20159v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) has emerged as a promising approach to leverage score-based diffusion models for solving high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. While initial applications of EnSF to the Lorenz-96 model and the quasi-geostrophic system showed potential, the current method employs a heuristic weighted sum to combine the prior and the likelihood score functions. This introduces a structural error into the estimation of the posterior score function in the nonlinear setting. This work addresses this challenge by developing an iterative ensemble score filter (IEnSF) that applies an iterative algorithm as an outer loop around the reverse-time stochastic differential equation solver. When the state dynamics or the observation operator is nonlinear, the iterative algorithm can gradually reduce the posterior score estimation error by improving the accuracy of approximating the conditional expectation of the likelihood score function. The number of iterations required depends on the distance between the prior and posterior distributions and the nonlinearity of the observation operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the IEnSF algorithm substantially reduces the error in posterior score estimation in the nonlinear setting and thus improves the accuracy of tracking high-dimensional dynamical systems.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 figures |

However, how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent AD cohort.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 14 figures, 64 references</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Generation for Long-Horizon Coupled PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20141v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled) data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon modeling of coupled PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SetONet: A Set-Based Operator Network for Solving PDEs with Variable-Input Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04738v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), have shown promise in learning mappings between function spaces for solving differential equations. However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability when sensor configurations vary or inputs exist on irregular grids. We introduce the Set Operator Network (SetONet), which modifies DeepONet's branch network to process input functions as unordered sets of location-value pairs. By incorporating Deep Sets principles, SetONet ensures permutation invariance while maintaining the same parameter count as the baseline. On classical operator-learning benchmarks, SetONet achieves parity with DeepONet on fixed layouts while sustaining accuracy under variable sensor configurations or sensor drop-off - conditions for which standard DeepONet is not applicable. More significantly, SetONet natively handles problems where inputs are naturally represented as unstructured point clouds (such as point sources or density samples) rather than values on fixed grids, a capability standard DeepONet lacks. On heat conduction with point sources, advection-diffusion modeling chemical plumes, and optimal transport between density samples, SetONet learns operators end-to-end without rasterization or multi-stage pipelines. These problems feature inputs that are naturally discrete point sets (point sources or density samples) rather than functions on fixed grids. SetONet is a DeepONet-class architecture that addresses such problems with a lightweight design, significantly broadening the applicability of operator learning to problems with variable, incomplete, or unstructured input data.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, e.g., non-physical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos, where 3D information is essential for perceiving shape and motion of interacting solids. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing video diffusion models to improve their visual plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: \url{https://snap-research.github.io/PointVidGen/}</p></details> |

To combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs.

| **[No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models. Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2) multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks, any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance. At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces. Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second, we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |
| **[Graph Representation Learning with Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13133v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.

Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2026 IEEE.

Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025.

Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features: a fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Steev...</summary><p>Steeve Laquitaine and Simone Azeglio have equal contributions; Ulisse Ferrari and Matthew Chalk have equal senior contributions</p></details> |

Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional evacuation simulation relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster, thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Sampling for Realized Variance Estimation in Time-Changed Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11833v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the benefits of sampling intraday returns in intrinsic time for the realized variance (RV) estimator. We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[IM-Chat: A Multi-agent LLM Framework Integrating Tool-Calling and Diffusion Modeling for Knowledge Transfer in Injection Molding Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15268v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeWak: Temporal Chained-Hashing Watermark for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06407v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in data space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in data space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the temporal-feature data space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series while preserving robust watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips2025</p></details> |

Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.12 and 1.69 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

In this work, we benchmark recent optimization algorithms for training a diffusion model for denoising flow trajectories. We observe that Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW (18% lower final loss). We also revisit several recent phenomena related to the training of models for text or image applications in the context of diffusion model training. This includes the impact of the learning-rate schedule on the training dynamics, and the performance gap between Adam and SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imitation Learning Policy based on Multi-Step Consistent Integration Shortcut Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19356v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference. Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loopholing Discrete Diffusion: Deterministic Bypass of the Sampling Wall](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19304v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall: once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades: initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context, triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel generation far superior to traditional denoising methods.

| **[D2D: Detector-to-Differentiable Critic for Improved Numeracy in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19278v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures |

While generative models have improved perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoders. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Our code is available at https://github.com/isno0907/ldmae.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major edit of methodology section.

| **[Step-Aware Residual-Guided Diffusion for EEG Spatial Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19166v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG) systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026 Conference Submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., "male" for "gender") in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose FairGen, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Furthermore, we address the limitations of existing datasets by introducing the Holistic Bias Evaluation (HBE) benchmark, which covers diverse domains and incorporates complex prompts to assess bias more comprehensively. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight FairGen's ability to flexibly control the output distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Camera Ready)</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cross-Environment and Cross-Embodiment Path Planning Framework via a Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19128v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines. Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3 (6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world settings.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[CtrlDiff: Boosting Large Diffusion Language Models with Dynamic Block Prediction and Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14455v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07634v5)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongBloom_demo. The code and model weights have been released on https://github.com/Cypress-Yang/SongBloom .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

A key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However, these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features, limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP$^2$O-SR: Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18851v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Protein generation with embedding learning for motif diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18790v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in protein design is the trade-off between generating structural diversity while preserving motif biological function. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail to resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to the native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric constraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation with Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns high-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a target motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen denoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled perturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric constraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse yet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a monomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor complex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better designability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion. Our results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein generation allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional motifs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an introduction paper. 28 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Buffer for Online Generative Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18744v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key advantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of data, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative Speech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a computational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement applications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative diffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network call per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement in an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion Buffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach progressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have more noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener with a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a corresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by carefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically aligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed UNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low. Moreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score Matching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic latency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped with a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency from 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it has been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform predictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online Diffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy speech data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Statistical Theory of Contrastive Pre-training and Multimodal Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04641v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal generative AI systems, such as those combining vision and language, rely on contrastive pre-training to learn representations across different modalities. While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RODS: Robust Optimization Inspired Diffusion Sampling for Detecting and Reducing Hallucination in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12201v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations-often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands demonstrate that RODS maintains comparable image quality and preserves generation diversity. More importantly, it improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

| **[Regression is all you need for medical image translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02048v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in natural image synthesis, their core strengths - creativity and realism - can be detrimental in medical applications, where accuracy and fidelity are paramount. These models instead risk introducing hallucinations and replication of unwanted acquisition noise. Here, we propose YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that conventional diffusion sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging. As this effectively approximates the DM's expected value, we term this Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression sampling YODA, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse multi-modal datasets - including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more efficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full diffusion sampling even with ExpA. Our results reveal that iterative refinement solely enhances perceptual realism without benefiting information translation, which we confirm in relevant downstream tasks. YODA outperforms eight state-of-the-art DMs and GANs and challenges the presumed superiority of DMs and GANs over computationally cheap regression models for high-quality MIT. Furthermore, we show that YODA-translated images are interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several medical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Spacetime of Diffusion Models: An Information Geometry Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17517v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel geometric perspective on the latent space of diffusion models. We first show that the standard pullback approach, utilizing the deterministic probability flow ODE decoder, is fundamentally flawed. It provably forces geodesics to decode as straight segments in data space, effectively ignoring any intrinsic data geometry beyond the ambient Euclidean space. Complementing this view, diffusion also admits a stochastic decoder via the reverse SDE, which enables an information geometric treatment with the Fisher-Rao metric. However, a choice of $x_T$ as the latent representation collapses this metric due to memorylessness. We address this by introducing a latent spacetime $z=(x_t,t)$ that indexes the family of denoising distributions $p(x_0 | x_t)$ across all noise scales, yielding a nontrivial geometric structure. We prove these distributions form an exponential family and derive simulation-free estimators for curve lengths, enabling efficient geodesic computation. The resulting structure induces a principled Diffusion Edit Distance, where geodesics trace minimal sequences of noise and denoise edits between data. We also demonstrate benefits for transition path sampling in molecular systems, including constrained variants such as low-variance transitions and region avoidance.

| **[Vision Foundation Models Can Be Good Tokenizers for Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18457v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models available at: https://github.com/tianciB/VFM-VAE</p></details> |

The method synthesizes volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions, enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |

We posit that a key challenge hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.</p></details> |  |

By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes.

These methods improve training stability by avoiding the REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning. Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and user studies.

TCCM is inspired by flow matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea -- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference; (2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

| **[Latent Diffusion Model without Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15301v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

In this paper, we propose GeoLayer, a geo-distributed graph storage framework that jointly optimizes graph replica placement and pattern request routing. We first construct a latency-aware layered graph architecture that decomposes the graph topology into multiple layers, aiming to reduce the decision space and computational complexity of the optimization problem, while mitigating the impact of network heterogeneity in geo-distributed environments. Building on the layered graph, we introduce an overlap-centric replica placement scheme to accommodate the diversity of graph pattern accesses, along with a directed heat diffusion model that captures heat conduction and superposition effects to guide data allocation. For request routing, we develop a stepwise layered routing strategy that performs progressive expansion over the layered graph to efficiently retrieve the required data. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art replica placement and routing schemes, GeoLayer achieves a 1.34x - 3.67x improvement in response times for online graph pattern requests and a 1.28x - 3.56x speedup in offline graph analysis performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[View Transformation Robustness for Multi-View 3D Object Reconstruction with Reconstruction Error-Guided View Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11428v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>View transformation robustness (VTR) is critical for deep-learning-based multi-view 3D object reconstruction models, which indicates the methods' stability under inputs with various view transformations. However, existing research seldom focused on view transformation robustness in multi-view 3D object reconstruction. One direct way to improve the models' VTR is to produce data with more view transformations and add them to model training. Recent progress on large vision models, particularly Stable Diffusion models, has provided great potential for generating 3D models or synthesizing novel view images with only a single image input. Directly deploying these models at inference consumes heavy computation resources and their robustness to view transformations is not guaranteed either. To fully utilize the power of Stable Diffusion models without extra inference computation burdens, we propose to generate novel views with Stable Diffusion models for better view transformation robustness. Instead of synthesizing random views, we propose a reconstruction error-guided view selection method, which considers the reconstruction errors' spatial distribution of the 3D predictions and chooses the views that could cover the reconstruction errors as much as possible. The methods are trained and tested on sets with large view transformations to validate the 3D reconstruction models' robustness to view transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods and other view transformation robustness comparison methods.

HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hoidini.github.io</p></details> |

Recent advances in steering protein generative models (e.g., diffusion models and language models) with labeled data offer a promising approach. However, most previous studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured through low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages over alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models. Overall, we provide practical insights into how to effectively steer modern generative models for next-generation protein fitness optimization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF): Diffusion-Guided Hypernetworks for Learning Implicit Molecular Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18122v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule, generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18114v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planned Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18087v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.</p></details> | <details><summary>autho...</summary><p>author comment: This version was previously removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission.

| **[OmniCast: A Masked Latent Diffusion Model for Weather Forecasting Across Time Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18707v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead. Code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/omnicast.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

Existing cross-platform information diffusion models often treat platforms as isolated systems, disregarding cross-platform activity that might make these patterns more predictable. In this work, we frame cross-platform prediction as a network proximity problem: rather than tracking individual users across platforms or relying on brittle signals like shared URLs or hashtags, we construct platform-invariant discourse networks that link users through shared narrative engagement. We show that cross-platform neighbor proximity provides a strong predictive signal: adoption patterns follow discourse network structure even without direct cross-platform influence. Our highly-scalable approach substantially outperforms diffusion models and other baselines while requiring less than 3% of active users to make predictions. We also validate our framework through retrospective deployment. We sequentially process a datastream of 5.7M social media posts occurred during the 2024 U.S. election, to simulate real-time collection from four platforms (X, TikTok, Truth Social, and Telegram): our framework successfully identified emerging narratives, including crises-related rumors, yielding over 94% AUC with sufficient lead time to support proactive intervention.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[GAS: Improving Discretization of Diffusion ODEs via Generalized Adversarial Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17699v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints.

However, most convergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target distribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions: weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential integrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based generative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic data distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees for the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the empirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a practical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing hyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets, demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled dataset.</p></details> |  |

This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines.

Recent empirical studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel smoothness-generalization dilemma, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in higher-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise and sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants.

However, solving this mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns, achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization.</p></details> |  |

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Yet, there are few known attempts to incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach successfully exploits.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantifying Distributional Invariance in Causal Subgraph for IRM-Free Graph Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20295v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing in Graph Neural Network for Chemical Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20236v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.</p></details> |  |

However, its accuracy often falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for future applications in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Robust Graph Neural Networks by Modeling Noise Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19670v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, node features in graphs often contain noise from various sources, leading to significant performance degradation in GNNs. Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/torch-DA-GNN.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables. v2: clarified over-squashing separation in light of related work</p></details> |

Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, harnessing the full potential of data-driven machine learning has become one of the important thrusts. In addition to the advancement in wireless technology, it is important to efficiently use the resources available and meet the users' requirements. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for effectively modeling and extracting insights which inherently exhibit complex network structures due to its high performance and accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. There is a lack of a comprehensive survey that focuses on the applications and advances GNN has made in the context of IoT and Next Generation (NextG) networks. To bridge that gap, this survey starts by providing a detailed description of GNN's terminologies, architecture, and the different types of GNNs. Then we provide a comprehensive survey of the advancements in applying GNNs for IoT from the perspective of data fusion and intrusion detection. Thereafter, we survey the impact GNN has made in improving spectrum awareness. Next, we provide a detailed account of how GNN has been leveraged for networking and tactical systems. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to learn more about GNN in the context of wireless networks, and understand its state-of-the-art use cases while contrasting to other machine learning approaches. Finally, we also discussed the challenges and wide range of future research directions to further motivate the use of GNN for IoT and NextG Networks.</p></details> |  |

The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite this momentum, the lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available at https://github.com/sybeam27/FnRGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20911v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |
| **[An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a learning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both concept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and covariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves complex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.</p></details> |  |

Yet, whether such long-range dependencies are essential remains unclear. We investigate if simple, domain-specific molecular fingerprints can capture peptide function without these assumptions. Atomic-level representation aims to provide richer information than purely sequence-based models and better efficiency than structural ones. Across 132 datasets, including LRGB and five other peptide benchmarks, models using count-based ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints with LightGBM achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Despite encoding only short-range molecular features, these models outperform GNNs and transformer-based approaches. Control experiments with sequence shuffling and amino acid counts confirm that fingerprints, though inherently local, suffice for robust peptide property prediction. Our results challenge the presumed necessity of long-range interaction modeling and highlight molecular fingerprints as efficient, interpretable, and computationally lightweight alternatives for peptide prediction.</p></details> |  |

Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages.

We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Metamers Reveal Invariances in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17378v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks (GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

However, effective fashion recommendation demands precise service for each customer with a deeper cognition of fashion. In this paper, we conduct the first study on fashion cognitive learning, which is fashion recommendations conditioned on personal physical information. To this end, we propose a Fashion Cognitive Network (FCN) to learn the relationships among visual-semantic embedding of outfit composition and appearance features of individuals. FCN contains two submodules, namely outfit encoder and Multi-label Graph Neural Network (ML-GCN). The outfit encoder uses a convolutional layer to encode an outfit into an outfit embedding. The latter module learns label classifiers via stacked GCN. We conducted extensive experiments on the newly collected O4U dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence that our framework outperforms alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness in Text-Attributed Graph Learning: Insights, Trade-offs, and New Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17185v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v6)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies face a vast hypothesis space, while interventions such as gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. To accelerate such experiments, gene perturbation models predict the transcriptional outcome of interventions. Since constructing the training set is challenging, active learning is often employed in a "lab-in-the-loop" process. While this strategy makes training more targeted, it is substantially slower, as it fails to exploit the inherent parallelizability of Perturb-seq experiments. Here, we focus on graph neural network-based gene perturbation models and propose a subset selection method that, unlike active learning, selects the training perturbations in one shot. Our method chooses the interventions that maximize the propagation of the supervision signal to the model. The selection criterion is defined over the input knowledge graph and is optimized with submodular maximization, ensuring a near-optimal guarantee. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that, in addition to providing months of acceleration compared to active learning, the method improves the stability of perturbation choices while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[UniGTE: Unified Graph-Text Encoding for Zero-Shot Generalization across Graph Tasks and Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16885v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues. UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable graph reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation-guided Interpolation Using Graph Neural Networks for High-Resolution Nowcasting in Switzerland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00017v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1km) and temporal (10 min) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed architecture combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We evaluate two models, one trained using local nowcasting analyses and one trained without, on multiple surface variables and compare it against operational high-resolution NWP (ICON-CH1) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. Results over the test period show that both GNNs consistently outperform ICON-CH1 when verified against INCA analyses across most variables and lead times. Relative to the INCA forecast system, scores against INCA analyses show AI gains beyond 2h (with early-lead disadvantages attributable to INCA's warm start from the analysis), while verification against held-out stations shows no systematic degradation at short lead-times for AI models and frequent outperformance across surface variables. A comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores for precipitation, pairwise significance testing and event-based evaluation, demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains. These results indicate that high-resolution, observation-guided GNNs can match or exceed the skill of established forecasting systems for short lead times, including when they are trained without nowcasting analyses.</p></details> | Updated 19.10.2025 |

However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, raising significant concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, existing defense methods face two main challenges: either the inability to establish a clear distinction between triggers and clean nodes, resulting in the removal of many clean nodes, or the failure to eliminate the impact of triggers, making it challenging to restore the target nodes to their pre-attack state. Through empirical analysis of various existing graph backdoor attacks, we observe that the triggers generated by these methods exhibit over-similarity in both features and structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel graph backdoor defense method SimGuard. We first utilizes a similarity-based metric to detect triggers and then employs contrastive learning to train a backdoor detector that generates embeddings capable of separating triggers from clean nodes, thereby improving detection efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method effectively defends against various graph backdoor attacks while preserving performance on clean nodes. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After discussions with one of the co-authors, it was decided that this version should not be made public at this time.

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, work in progress</p></details> |

Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.</p></details> |  |

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</p></details> |  |

Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |

While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Elsevier Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

In order to further improve the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model achieves better results than other neural network methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault Cause Identification across Manufacturing Lines through Ontology-Guided and Process-Aware FMEA Graph Learning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15428v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault cause identification in automated manufacturing lines is challenging due to the system's complexity, frequent reconfigurations, and the limited reusability of existing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge. Although FMEA worksheets contain valuable expert insights, their reuse across heterogeneous lines is hindered by natural language variability, inconsistent terminology, and process differences. To address these limitations, this study proposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining manufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN) reasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are transformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large language model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions, states, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that respect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link prediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with the target line's process flow. A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400), achieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization and process-aware learning. These results indicate that the proposed framework significantly improves the transferability of FMEA knowledge across heterogeneous lines, thereby supporting operators in diagnosing failures more reliably and paving the way for future domain-adaptive LLM applications in smart manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce high-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |

However, existing defenses typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover, we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts. Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple graph adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual Correction Models for AC Optimal Power Flow Using DC Optimal Power Flow Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16064v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Generalized Model for Substation Level Voltage Estimation in Distribution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16063v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however, struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for distribution systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Traffic Prediction in Distributed Backend Systems via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15215v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of traffic prediction in distributed backend systems and proposes a graph neural network based modeling approach to overcome the limitations of traditional models in capturing complex dependencies and dynamic features. The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges, where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features, topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Generalization for Microservice Routing Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15210v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on intelligent routing in microservice systems and proposes an end-to-end optimization framework based on graph neural networks. The goal is to improve routing decision efficiency and overall system performance under complex topologies. The method models invocation relationships among microservices as a graph. In this graph, service nodes and communication links are treated as graph nodes and edges. Multi-dimensional features such as node states, link latency, and call frequency are used as input. A multi-layer graph neural network is employed to perform high-order information aggregation and structural modeling. The model outputs a score for each candidate service path. These scores are then used to guide dynamic routing decisions. To improve the model's ability to assess path quality, an edge-aware attention mechanism is introduced. This mechanism helps the model capture instability and bottleneck risks in service communications more accurately. The paper also conducts a systematic analysis of the model's performance under different network depths, topology densities, and service scales. It evaluates the effectiveness of the method in terms of routing accuracy, prediction error, and system stability. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream strategies across multiple key metrics. It handles highly dynamic and concurrent microservice environments effectively and demonstrates strong performance, robustness, and structural generalization.</p></details> |  |

With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.</p></details> |  |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning models can be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws. Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of 3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN) significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution. It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[RoBCtrl: Attacking GNN-Based Social Bot Detectors via Reinforced Manipulation of Bots Control Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16035v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors. Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the performance of GNN-based detectors.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Frontiers in Bioinformatics</p></details> |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |

Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages content. 2 pages references</p></details> |

While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs.

However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation.

To optimize this process, existing works often employs message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict quality of results (QoR). These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models based on MPNNs struggle with over-smoothing and limited expressiveness. Additionally, while meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design operators and time-consuming tuning. To address these limitations, we propose ECoGNNs-LLMMHs, a framework that integrates graph neural networks with task-adaptive message passing and large language model-enhanced meta-heuristic algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art works, ECoGNN exhibits lower prediction error in the post-HLS prediction task, with the error reduced by 57.27\%. For post-implementation prediction tasks, ECoGNN demonstrates the lowest prediction errors, with average reductions of 17.6\% for flip-flop (FF) usage, 33.7\% for critical path (CP) delay, 26.3\% for power consumption, 38.3\% for digital signal processor (DSP) utilization, and 40.8\% for BRAM usage. LLMMH variants can generate superior Pareto fronts compared to meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of average distance from the reference set (ADRS) with average improvements of 87.47\%, respectively. Compared with the SOTA DSE approaches GNN-DSE and IRONMAN-PRO, LLMMH can reduce the ADRS by 68.17\% and 63.07\% respectively.</p></details> |  |

One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universally Invariant Learning in Equivariant GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13169v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc Popularity Bias Correction in GNN-based Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12959v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User historical interaction data is the primary signal for learning user preferences in collaborative filtering (CF). However, the training data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where only a few items have the majority of interactions. CF models trained directly on such imbalanced data are prone to learning popularity bias, which reduces personalization and leads to suboptimal recommendation quality. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while effective for CF due to their message passing mechanism, can further propagate and amplify popularity bias through their aggregation process. Existing approaches typically address popularity bias by modifying training objectives but fail to directly counteract the bias propagated during GNN's neighborhood aggregation. Applying weights to interactions during aggregation can help alleviate this problem, yet it risks distorting model learning due to unstable node representations in the early stages of training. In this paper, we propose a Post-hoc Popularity Debiasing (PPD) method that corrects for popularity bias in GNN-based CF and operates directly on pre-trained embeddings without requiring retraining. By estimating interaction-level popularity and removing popularity components from node representations via a popularity direction vector, PPD reduces bias while preserving user preferences.

While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Multi-View Graph Learning with Graph-Tuple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10341v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAG workshop</p></details> |
| **[Multitask finetuning and acceleration of chemical pretrained models for small molecule drug property prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12719v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-based Path Dominance Embedding (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |
| **[PromoGuardian: Detecting Promotion Abuse Fraud with Multi-Relation Fused Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12652v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As e-commerce platforms develop, fraudulent activities are increasingly emerging, posing significant threats to the security and stability of these platforms. Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in recent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to gain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we conduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms MEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent activity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback Abuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion abuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate transactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often intertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional information from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion abuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation fused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information of transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision, detecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times more financial losses in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2026</p></details> |
| **[Computing Systemic Risk Measures with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

SpaPool groups vertices into an adaptive number of clusters, leveraging the benefits of both dense and sparse approaches. It aims to maintain the structural integrity of the graph while reducing its size efficiently. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SpaPool achieves competitive performance compared to existing pooling techniques and excels particularly on small-scale graphs. This makes SpaPool a promising method for applications requiring efficient and effective graph processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
