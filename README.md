| **[Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TESSERA: Temporal Embeddings of Surface Spectra for Earth Representation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite remote sensing from repeated observations and multiple sensors enables a wide range of downstream applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15196v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Probabilistic Modeling with LLM for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10774v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Motion Diffusion Autoencoders: Enabling Attribute Manipulation in Human Motion Demonstrated on Karate Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18729v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PREIG: Physics-informed and Reinforcement-driven Interpretable GRU for Commodity Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21710v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Attention Mechanism: Boosting the Transformer Architecture for Long-Sequence Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03805v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the leading choice in natural language processing over other deep learning architectures. This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time. In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUARD-CAN: Graph-Understanding and Recurrent Architecture for CAN Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21640v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex feature engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments:12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; accepted to the 26th World Conference on Information Security Applications (WISA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Latent Manifold Learning in Neural Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21531v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models, recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic forest transition model dynamics and parameter estimation via deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21486v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest, agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future time.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Sparsity Likelihood-based (SL-based) score and the change-points detection procedure in multivariate normal model with general covariance structure. SL-based algorithm is proved to achieve that supremum of error probabilities converges to 0. We run the simulation studies for SL-based algorithm and also illustrate its applications to a S&P500 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Tier Supply Chain Ordering with LNN+XGBoost: Mitigating the Bullwhip Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21383v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks, inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for dynamic and efficient supply chain management.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18972v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in TVCG (IEEE VIS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Contrastive Diffusion-based Network (CDNet) for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21357v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</p></details> | 19 pages, conference |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Stationary Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563v5)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``immersion-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R^2 was used as a confidence metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation. Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient, generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly configurable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Cognition from fMRI:A Comparative Study of Graph, Transformer, and Kernel Models Across Task and Rest Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21016v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |
| **[From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The approach, based on periodograms and Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component - the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities, i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be treated as approximately normally distributed.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Watermarking Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20762v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However, this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns, we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain detectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold tokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and detects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise within a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting via Partially Asymmetric Convolution and Sub-Sliding Window Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20641v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Explainable Stock Predictions with Tweets Using Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20535v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price movements are influenced by many factors, and alongside historical price data, tex-tual information is a key source. Public news and social media offer valuable insights into market sentiment and emerging events. These sources are fast-paced, diverse, and significantly impact future stock trends. Recently, LLMs have enhanced financial analysis, but prompt-based methods still have limitations, such as input length restrictions and difficulties in predicting sequences of varying lengths. Additionally, most models rely on dense computational layers, which are resource-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose the FTS- Text-MoE model, which combines numerical data with key summaries from news and tweets using point embeddings, boosting prediction accuracy through the integration of factual textual data. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer decoder to process both data types. By activating only a subset of model parameters, it reduces computational costs. Furthermore, the model features multi-resolution prediction heads, enabling flexible forecasting of financial time series at different scales. Experimental results show that FTS-Text-MoE outperforms baseline methods in terms of investment returns and Sharpe ratio, demonstrating its superior accuracy and ability to predict future market trends.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Interpretable Anomaly-Based DDoS Detection in AI-RAN with XAI and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21193v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability, intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers, enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE) behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and interpretable outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trends in Motion Prediction Toward Deployable and Generalizable Autonomy: A Revisit and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

| **[Semi-Supervised Risk Control via Prediction-Powered Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11174v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) framework is a general tool for transforming the output of any machine learning model to design a predictive rule with rigorous error rate control. The key idea behind this framework is to use labeled hold-out calibration data to tune a hyper-parameter that affects the error rate of the resulting prediction rule. However, the limitation of such a calibration scheme is that with limited hold-out data, the tuned hyper-parameter becomes noisy and leads to a prediction rule with an error rate that is often unnecessarily conservative. To overcome this sample-size barrier, we introduce a semi-supervised calibration procedure that leverages unlabeled data to rigorously tune the hyper-parameter without compromising statistical validity. Our procedure builds upon the prediction-powered inference framework, carefully tailoring it to risk-controlling tasks. We demonstrate the benefits and validity of our proposal through two real-data experiments: few-shot image classification and early time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce Insider Filing Delay (IFD), the first and largest publicly available dataset for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002-2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1-score of up to 99.47% under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich benchmark for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time-series classification.

| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |

Using daily stock data from the S&P 500 (2020-2024), we construct dependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based network. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to quantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty information we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By applying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core inter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A dynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital allocated based on Value at Risk (VaR). To refine stock selection, we incorporate forecasts from ARIMA and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) models. Trading simulations over a one-year period demonstrate that the MST-based strategies outperform a buy-and-hold benchmark, with the tuned NNAR-enhanced strategy achieving a 63.74% return versus 18.00% for the benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of combining network structures, predictive modeling, and risk metrics to improve adaptive financial decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[$K^2$VAE: A Koopman-Kalman Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23017v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</p></details> |  |

Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli.

| **[Elucidating the Design Choice of Probability Paths in Flow Matching for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03229v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling and has been extended to probabilistic time series forecasting in latent spaces. However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al. (2023) for which the convergence rates of the associated estimators may suffer from small eigengaps as the asymptotic theory is based on some matrix perturbation analysis, the proposed new method enjoys faster convergence rates which are free from any eigengaps. It achieves this by turning the problem into a joint diagonalization of several matrices whose elements are determined by a basis of a linear system, and by choosing the basis carefully to avoid near co-linearity (see Proposition 5 and Section 4.3). Furthermore, unlike Chang et al. (2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the proposed new method can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices. Illustration with both simulated and real matrix time series data shows the advantages of the proposed new method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skin-Machine Interface with Multimodal Contact Motion Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19760v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures (accepted in Humanoids2025)</p></details> |

Making sound trading decisions to generate profit is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks. These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022 and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and 48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods.

Despite extensive research in domains like computer vision and natural language processing, UDA remains underexplored for time series data, which has widespread real-world applications ranging from medicine and manufacturing to earth observation and human activity recognition. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating UDA techniques for time series classification, with a focus on deep learning methods. We provide seven new benchmark datasets covering various domain shifts and temporal dynamics, facilitating fair and standardized UDA method assessments with state of the art neural network backbones (e.g. Inception) for time series data. This benchmark offers insights into the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches while preserving the unsupervised nature of domain adaptation, making it directly applicable to practical problems. Our paper serves as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners, advancing domain adaptation solutions for time series data and fostering innovation in this critical field.

| **[Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19409v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions -- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE (Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.</p></details> |  |

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5).

Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes (KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism, enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming existing methods.

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations.

We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods. SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA-SSM: Varying and Irregular Sampling Time-series Analysis via State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21527v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VISTA, a clustering approach for multivariate and irregularly sampled time series based on a parametric state space mixture model. VISTA is specifically designed for the unsupervised identification of groups in datasets originating from healthcare and psychology where such sampling issues are commonplace. Our approach adapts linear Gaussian state space models (LGSSMs) to provide a flexible parametric framework for fitting a wide range of time series dynamics. The clustering approach itself is based on the assumption that the population can be represented as a mixture of a fixed number of LGSSMs. VISTA's model formulation allows for an explicit derivation of the log-likelihood function, from which we develop an expectation-maximization scheme for fitting model parameters to the observed data samples. Our algorithmic implementation is designed to handle populations of multivariate time series that can exhibit large changes in sampling rate as well as irregular sampling. We evaluate the versatility and accuracy of our approach on simulated and real-world datasets, including demographic trends, wearable sensor data, epidemiological time series, and ecological momentary assessments. Our results indicate that VISTA outperforms most comparable standard times series clustering methods. We provide an open-source implementation of VISTA in Python.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We show the proposed estimators are consistent and follow normal distributions in large samples under weak conditions. We also provide a precise characterisation of the leading bias term due to smoothing, which has not been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our general results by establishing primitive conditions for local (quasi-)maximum-likelihood estimators of time-varying models threshold autoregressions, ARCH models and Poisson autogressions with exogenous co--variates, to be normally distributed in large samples and characterise their leading biases. An empirical study of US corporate default counts demonstrates the applicability of the proposed local linear estimator for Poisson autoregression, shedding new light on the dynamic properties of US corporate defaults.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TempXAI Workshop @ ECML-PKDD 2025 (Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams)</p></details> |

However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, highlighting the role of NDVI in the synergy between SAR and optical data. We demonstrate the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated NDVI time series on the downstream task of grassland mowing event detection. We conducted our study in Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compared our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method outperformed these techniques, achieving an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.024 and a coefficient of determination R^2 of 0.92. Additionally, our analysis revealed improvement in the performance of the mowing event detection, with F1-score up to 84% using two widely applied mowing detection methodologies. Our method also effectively mitigated sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations, which are often missed by conventional cloud masks and adversely affect mowing detection precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Then, we deduce the asymptotic distribution of the entropy-complexity pair, which emerged as a popular tool for summarizing the time-series dynamics. Here, we make the necessary distinction between a uniform and a non-uniform ordinal pattern distribution and, thus, obtain two different limit theorems. On this basis, we consider a test for serial dependence and check its finite-sample performance. Moreover, we use our asymptotic results to approximate the estimation uncertainty of entropy-complexity pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of journal paper in preparation.

Our method, Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI), leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score. CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in identifying anomalous segments within them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at Runtime Verification 25</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity, and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However, monitoring weed management methods is challenging as they commonly rely on ground-based field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In order to tackle this problem, we leverage earth observation data and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed separate ML models using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellite time series data, respectively, to classify four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and No practice) in orchards. The findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically adopt either channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone, while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85.

However, its core component, self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference, DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.</p></details> |  |

This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact. This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of FL tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw the current version of the manuscript to improve its structure, clarify some arguments, and incorporate additional results.

However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready. v5: Fix typo in statement of Theorem 5</p></details> |

However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 figures.

Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Density Prediction of Income Distribution Based on Mixed Frequency Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16150v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling large dependent datasets in modern time series analysis is a crucial research area. One effective approach to handle such datasets is to transform the observations into density functions and apply statistical methods for further analysis. Income distribution forecasting, a common application scenario, benefits from predicting density functions as it accounts for uncertainty around point estimates, leading to more informed policy formulation. However, predictive modeling becomes challenging when dealing with mixed-frequency data. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a mixed data sampling regression model for probability density functions (PDF-MIDAS). To mitigate variance inflation caused by high-frequency prediction variables, we utilize exponential Almon polynomials with fewer parameters to regularize the coefficient structure. Additionally, we propose an iterative estimation method based on quadratic programming and the BFGS algorithm. Simulation analyses demonstrate that as the sample size for estimating density functions and observation length increase, the estimator approaches the true value. Real data analysis reveals that compared to single-sequence prediction models, PDF-MIDAS incorporating high-frequency exogenous variables offers a wider range of application scenarios with superior fitting and prediction performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |

We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose to reverse the construction principle by considering preselected sets of interest and estimating the probability that a future observation of the process falls into these sets. The accuracy of the prediction is then evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimation of these predictive probabilities. We consider parametric and non-parametric approaches and derive asymptotic theory for the estimators involved. Suitable bootstrap approaches to evaluate the distribution of the estimators considered also are introduced. They have the advantage to imitate the distributions of interest under different possible settings, including the practical important case where uncertainty holds true about the correctness of a parametric model used for prediction. Theoretical justification of the bootstrap is given, which also requires investigation of asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under model misspecification. We elaborate on bootstrap implementations under different scenarios and focus on parametric prediction using INAR and INARCH models and (conditional) maximum likelihood estimators. Simulations investigate the finite sample performance of the predictive method developed and applications to real life data sets are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.</p></details> | <details><summary>For o...</summary><p>For ongoing updates and to track the latest advances in this promising area, we maintain a public repository: https://github.com/cokeshao/Awesome-Multimodal-Token-Compression</p></details> |

Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency, further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and immersive storytelling experiences.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Acta Astronautica</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise trading framework to achieve efficient and stable task-worker matching, explicitly accounting for task diversity (e.g., spatio-temporal limitations) and network dynamics inherent in MCS environments. This framework integrates both futures and spot trading stages. In the former, we introduce the \textbf{f}utures \textbf{t}rading-driven \textbf{s}table \textbf{m}atching and \textbf{p}re-\textbf{p}ath-\textbf{p}lanning mechanism (FT-SMP$^3$), which enables long-term task-worker assignment and pre-planning of workers' trajectories based on historical statistics and risk-aware analysis. In the latter, we develop the \textbf{s}pot \textbf{t}rading-driven \textbf{D}QN-based \textbf{p}ath \textbf{p}lanning and onsite \textbf{w}orker \textbf{r}ecruitment mechanism (ST-DP$^2$WR), which dynamically improves the practical utilities of tasks and workers by supporting real-time recruitment and path adjustment. We rigorously prove that the proposed mechanisms satisfy key economic and algorithmic properties, including stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiements further validate the effectiveness of our framework in realistic network settings, demonstrating superior performance in terms of service quality, computational efficiency, and decision-making overhead.</p></details> |  |

Existing plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality. Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Buildings with similar features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting via Partially Asymmetric Convolution and Sub-Sliding Window Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20641v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the experimental results.</p></details> |  |

The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |

For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study, we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models. Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps. Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge, especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation, abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion. Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries. This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training, surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve 54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse.

| **[Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes, making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset, resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions, paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

| **[RealisVSR: Detail-enhanced Diffusion for Real-World 4K Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19138v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss) combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing 1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS, SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification. The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots across various STL specifications.

| **[Motion Synthesis with Sparse and Flexible Keyjoint Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15557v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating expressive character animations is labor-intensive, requiring intricate manual adjustment of animators across space and time. Previous works on controllable motion generation often rely on a predefined set of dense spatio-temporal specifications (e.g., dense pelvis trajectories with exact per-frame timing), limiting practicality for animators. To process high-level intent and intuitive control in diverse scenarios, we propose a practical controllable motions synthesis framework that respects sparse and flexible keyjoint signals. Our approach employs a decomposed diffusion-based motion synthesis framework that first synthesizes keyjoint movements from sparse input control signals and then synthesizes full-body motion based on the completed keyjoint trajectories. The low-dimensional keyjoint movements can easily adapt to various control signal types, such as end-effector position for diverse goal-driven motion synthesis, or incorporate functional constraints on a subset of keyjoints. Additionally, we introduce a time-agnostic control formulation, eliminating the need for frame-specific timing annotations and enhancing control flexibility. Then, the shared second stage can synthesize a natural whole-body motion that precisely satisfies the task requirement from dense keyjoint movements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse and flexible keyjoint control through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Captain Cinema: Towards Short Movie Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18634v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation. Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g., scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning. These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model, which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works, we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency.

| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

| **[INLA-RF: A Hybrid Modeling Strategy for Spatio-Temporal Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18488v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental processes often exhibit complex, non-linear patterns and discontinuities across space and time, posing significant challenges for traditional geostatistical modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |

These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed.

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |

The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video.

Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of ECAI 2025</p></details> |

However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</p></details> |  |

However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vascular Segmentation of Functional Ultrasound Images using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22365v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation of medical images is a fundamental task with numerous applications. While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited from deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like functional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive imaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high spatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based segmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from different vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness. This work offers a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to ULM, enhancing fUS data interpretation and improving understanding of vessel function. Our pipeline shows high linear correlation coefficients between signals from predicted and actual compartments in both cortical and deeper regions, showcasing its ability to accurately capture blood flow dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Met$^2$Net: A Decoupled Two-Stage Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Model for Complex Meteorological Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17189v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques, but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue, but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by 28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively.

| **[IONext: Unlocking the Next Era of Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17089v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU), which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry (IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by 10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.</p></details> |  |

The problem is defined as multiple depot pickup and delivery with time windows constrained over operational restrictions, such as vehicle battery limitation, precedence time window, and building obstruction. Utilizing the coalition game theory, we investigate cooperation structures among the modes to capture how strategic collaboration can improve overall routing efficiency. To do so, a generalized reinforcement learning model is designed to evaluate the cost-sharing and allocation to different modes to learn the cooperative behaviour with respect to various realistic scenarios. Our methodology leverages an end-to-end deep multi-agent policy gradient method augmented by a novel spatio-temporal adjacency neighbourhood graph attention network using a heterogeneous edge-enhanced attention model and transformer architecture. Several numerical experiments on last-mile delivery applications have been conducted, showing the results from the case study in the city of Mississauga, which shows that despite the incorporation of an extensive network in the graph for two modes and a complex training structure, the model addresses realistic operational constraints and achieves high-quality solutions compared with the existing transformer-based and classical methods. It can perform well on non-homogeneous data distribution, generalizes well on different scales and configurations, and demonstrates a robust cooperative performance under stochastic scenarios across various tasks, which is effectively reflected by coalition analysis and cost allocation to signify the advantage of cooperation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[METER: Multi-modal Evidence-based Thinking and Explainable Reasoning -- Algorithm and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16206v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images, videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations, including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned, three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning. We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative media.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures ICCV format</p></details> |

This work presents a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to model vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with particular emphasis on disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the maritime domain into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for distinct vessel types using cell transition frequencies and dwell times. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize maritime dynamics across multiple temporal resolutions. Focusing on commercial, fishing, and passenger vessels, we analyze the temporal evolution of mobility behaviors during the pandemic, highlighting significant yet transient disruptions to recurring transport patterns. The methodology we contribute to this paper allows for an extensive behavioral analytics key for transportation planning. Accordingly, our findings reveal vessel-specific mobility signatures that persist across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting behaviors invariant to time. In contrast, we observe temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, reflecting the influence of social isolation measures and operational constraints on non-essential maritime transport in this region.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |

This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynImg: Key Frames with Visual Prompts are Good Representation for Multi-Modal Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15569v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent. However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

Hawkes processes form a class of selfexciting simple point processes. In this article, we consider a general class of multivariate Hawkes processes envisioned to model dynamics of spatio-temporal epidemics. For this class, the igniting baseline intensity is time dependent and the exciting matrix function is a general one, making the model non-Markovian in most of the cases. In this article, we first provide the closed-form expression of the multivariate multi-temporal characteristic function of these Hawkes processes, extending in a natural way the classical single-time formula found in the Hawkes literature. Then, we use the infinitely divisible property of the Hawkes process to derive the equation system related to the probability distribution of counts at each single time, adapted to the general formulation of the Hawkes model considered in this article. Next, we provide closed-form formulas for the temporal structure of the two first moments of the process, which allows us to deduce an original expression of the multivariate covariance function at two distinct times, thereby extending existing results established for more restricted classes of Hawkes processes. Based on this expression, we analytically decompose the covariance at two distinct times into singular and continuous parts. We finish with brief numerical elements: We present a simple scheme for numerical approximations of the Laplace transform and the first two moments, and give examples of solutions of the different related integral equations. We also provides illustrative simulations of the multivariate Hawkes process for different model specifications.</p></details> |  |

Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |

Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

Statisticians and others have long been interested in this problem, which has led to several practical and innovative solutions dating back decades. In this overview, we focus on the problem of data-driven prediction and inference of dynamic spatio-temporal processes that include mechanistic information, such as would be available from partial differential equations, with a strong focus on the quantification of uncertainty associated with data, process, and parameters. We give a brief review of several paradigms and focus our attention on Bayesian implementations given they naturally accommodate uncertainty quantification. We then specify a general Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for spatio-temporal data that can accommodate these mechanistic-informed process approaches. The advantage of this framework is its flexibility and generalizability. We illustrate the methodology via a simulation study in which a nonlinear Burgers' equation PDE is embedded via a Bayesian PINN.</p></details> |  |

RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length.

| **[Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12214v7)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operation of water distribution networks simply aims at efficiently delivering consumers adequate water while maintaining safe water quality (WQ). However, this process entails a multi-scale interplay between hydraulic and WQ dynamics evolving spatio-temporally within such a complex infrastructure network. While prior research has addressed the hydraulic optimization problem and WQ regulation as decoupled or coupled, they often overlook control-theoretic guided solutions. This paper takes a novel approach by investigating the coupling between hydraulic and WQ dynamics from a control networks perspective. We propose a quality-aware control framework that embeds WQ controllability metrics into the network-level pump scheduling problem, acknowledging the direct influence of system hydraulics on WQ controller behavior. We examine the trade-offs between pump control energy cost and WQ performance across various network sizes and scenarios. Our results showcase how network topology, hydraulic constraints, and WQ metrics jointly impact optimal pump schedules and, accordingly, the achievable level of WQ regulation, offering insights into designing efficient control strategies for water infrastructure networks governed by interdependent dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures, |

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Key innovations include: a merge network replacing traditional dot-product operations, achieving 50.4% reduction in prediction error and 7.57% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by 96%; a transfer learning multi-fidelity approach that freezes pre-trained low-fidelity networks while making only the merge network trainable, outperforming alternatives by up to 76% and achieving 43.7% better accuracy than single-fidelity training; and a physics-guided subsampling method that strategically selects high-fidelity training points based on temporal dynamics, reducing high-fidelity sample requirements by 40% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

| **[FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12816v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features, ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> | SMC 2025 |

This paper investigates the effectiveness of Reservoir Computing in capturing rogue wave dynamics from the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, a challenging Hamiltonian system with modulation instability. The model-free approach learns from breather simulations with five unstable modes. A properly tuned parallel Echo State Network can predict dynamics from two distinct testing datasets. The first set is a continuation of the training data, whereas the second set involves a higher-order breather. An investigation of the one-step prediction capability shows remarkable agreement between the testing data and the models. Furthermore, we show that the trained reservoir can predict the propagation of rogue waves over a relatively long prediction horizon, despite facing unseen dynamics. Finally, we introduce a method to significantly improve the Reservoir Computing prediction in autonomous mode, enhancing its long-term forecasting ability. These results advance the application of Reservoir Computing to spatio-temporal Hamiltonian systems and highlight the critical importance of phase space coverage in the design of training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages 14 figures.

However, this objective is limited by two fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators, effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise. Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.</p></details> |  |

Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address this issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are often limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under ill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an efficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct dynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative capabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency optimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically, we first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion models, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of velocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent side-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of single-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints. Subsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of front-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry novel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative process that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing novel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences. Finally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity field, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose CAMERA (Context-Aware Multi-modal Enhanced Risk Anticipation), a multi-modal framework integrating dashcam video, textual annotations, and driver attention maps for robust accident anticipation. Unlike existing methods that rely on static or environment-centric thresholds, CAMERA employs an adaptive mechanism guided by scene complexity and gaze entropy, reducing false alarms while maintaining high recall in dynamic, multi-agent traffic scenarios. A hierarchical fusion pipeline with Bi-GRU (Bidirectional GRU) captures spatio-temporal dependencies, while a Geo-Context Vision-Language module translates 3D spatial relationships into interpretable, human-centric alerts. Evaluations on the DADA-2000 and benchmarks show that CAMERA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy and lead time.

However, these methods consider cells as independent data points of population distributions. With spatial transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED) integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate representation of cellular dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation. However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench: the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX: Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a) generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs.

| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Impute With Confidence: A Framework for Uncertainty Aware Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09353v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data with missing values is common across many domains. Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIM-SUM: Dynamic IMputation for Smart Utility Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20023v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values. However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSCD: Lomb-Scargle Conditioned Diffusion for Time series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17039v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks. Codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |

Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding.

In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

Despite their strengths, they struggle with capturing high-dimensional distributions and cross-feature dependencies. Recent work explores generative approaches using diffusion or flow-based models, extending to time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability remains a challenge. This work proposes a novel method combining recurrent neural networks' efficiency with diffusion models' probabilistic modeling, based on stochastic interpolants and conditional generation with control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios.

Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world. The code is open source on GitHub at https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in the journal Expert Systems with Applications.

| **[MADS: Modulated Auto-Decoding SIREN for time series imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00868v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation remains a significant challenge across many fields due to the potentially significant variability in the type of data being modelled. Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Networked Time Series Imputation via Position-aware Graph Enhanced Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18612v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework based on the principles of recurrent neural networks and neural stochastic differential equations for reconciling irregularly sampled measurements. We impute measurements at any arbitrary timescale and quantify the uncertainty in the imputations in a principled manner. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantifying and propagating the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across time instants. Our experiments on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution system reveal that our framework can outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification approaches for time-series data imputations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Time-Series Imputation with Wasserstein Interpolation for Optimal Look-Ahead-Bias and Variance Tradeoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12736v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing time-series data is a prevalent practical problem. Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.</p></details> |  |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |

While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines.

These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |

For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |
| **[ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03310v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures V3: Revised significantly.

While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025). https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34173</p></details> |

In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v6)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |

These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

Existing works typically assume regularly sampled, well-structured data, limiting their applicability to more generalized scenarios where time series often contain missing values, unequal sequence lengths, and irregular time intervals between measurements. To cover diverse domains and handle variable regularities, we propose FlexTSF, a universal time series forecasting model that possesses better generalization and natively support both regular and irregular time series. FlexTSF produces forecasts in an autoregressive manner and incorporates three novel designs: VT-Norm, a normalization strategy to ablate data domain barriers, IVP Patcher, a patching module to learn representations from flexibly structured time series, and LED attention, an attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these two and propagate forecasts with awareness of domain and time information. Experiments on 12 datasets show that FlexTSF outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models respectively designed for regular and irregular time series. Furthermore, after self-supervised pre-training, FlexTSF shows exceptional performance in both zero-shot and few-show settings for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |

We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |

This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy.

They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series.

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08732v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqLink: A Robust Neural-ODE Architecture for Modelling Partially Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03560v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models have become popular as foundation models for solving many time series problems. Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer-based Imbalanced Longitudinal Learning for Glaucoma Forecasting from Irregular Time Series Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13475v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glaucoma is one of the major eye diseases that leads to progressive optic nerve fiber damage and irreversible blindness, afflicting millions of individuals. Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |

Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |

Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |
| **[It is all Connected: A New Graph Formulation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13177v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With an ever-increasing number of sensors in modern society, spatio-temporal time series forecasting has become a de facto tool to make informed decisions about the future. Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learnable Path in Neural Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04333v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs), which are continuous analogues to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are a specialized model in (irregular) time-series processing. In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Time series data types can be broadly classified into regular or irregular. However, there are no existing generative models that show good performance for both types without any model changes. Therefore, we present a general purpose model capable of synthesizing regular and irregular time series data. To our knowledge, we are the first designing a general purpose time series synthesis model, which is one of the most challenging settings for time series synthesis. To this end, we design a generative adversarial network-based method, where many related techniques are carefully integrated into a single framework, ranging from neural ordinary/controlled differential equations to continuous time-flow processes. Our method outperforms all existing methods.</p></details> | NeurIPs 2022 |
| **[EXIT: Extrapolation and Interpolation-based Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Time-series Classification and Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08771v2)** | 2022-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning inspired by differential equations is a recent research trend and has marked the state of the art performance for many machine learning tasks. Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |
| **[Features Fusion Framework for Multimodal Irregular Time-series Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01728v1)** | 2022-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some data from multiple sources can be modeled as multimodal time-series events which have different sampling frequencies, data compositions, temporal relations and characteristics. Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop&Hop: Early Classification of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09795v1)** | 2022-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early classification algorithms help users react faster to their machine learning model's predictions. Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

| **[Modeling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11344v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modeling sequential data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |

Hence, a model that combines the use of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and RNN was proposed (ODE-RNN) to model irregular time series with higher accuracy, but it suffers from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |

However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches focus on classification, regression or forecasting tasks on such data.

| **[Discrete-time autoregressive model for unequally spaced time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11158v1)** | 2019-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore, it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIVE: Taming DINO for Subject-Driven Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03347v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the success of diffusion models in image generation and editing, video editing has recently gained substantial attention. However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing.

While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuidPaint: Class-Guided Image Inpainting with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21627v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locally Controlled Face Aging with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21600v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process, enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging: robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a natural, controllable aging progression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/HeadHunter/</p></details> |

However, current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while preserving their geometric and semantic coherence. BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling 2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows. The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry, associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on creation that resonates with human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://sites.google.com/view/bang7355608</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision on the validation set. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78\% to 93\% when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, published in Computer and Decision Making - An International Journal (COMDEM)</p></details> |
| **[LoRA-Loop: Closing the Synthetic Replay Cycle for Continual VLM Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13568v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Gallery to Wrist: Realistic 3D Bracelet Insertion in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20331v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing.

| **[Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Speeding up Diffusion Policy without Additional Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21452v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks. However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy (CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP (Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy, with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegQuant: A Semantics-Aware and Generalizable Quantization Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14811v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs ($>77$ tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP, which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images, respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.

However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://github.com/LogSSim/MP1.git.</p></details> |  |

While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and challenging urban scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</p></details> | 19 pages, conference |
| **[HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation, the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and lighting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However, integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple, heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved accuracy using Adam-PnP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/amartya21/Adam-PnP</p></details> |
| **[Flow Matching Policy Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21053v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models. Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies, particularly in under-conditioned settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our blog post: https://flowreinforce.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Vehicle Detectors for Aerial Imagery to Unseen Domains with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20976v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application. However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle) leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments. Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than 50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

| **[Model-Agnostic Gender Bias Control for Text-to-Image Generation via Sparse Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20973v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint modeling for learning decision-making dynamics in behavioral experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02394v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability and mortality, is associated with reward-processing abnormalities and concentration issues. Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged'' state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing, decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed'' state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms competing approaches across various reward-generating distributions, under both strategy-switching and non-switching scenarios, as well as in the presence of input perturbations. When applied to the EMBARC study, our framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage. Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavior association specific to the ''engaged'' state.</p></details> |  |

In this work we focus on its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR.

While existing object-centric approaches either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion, deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+21...</summary><p>12+21 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), currently under review</p></details> |
| **[AIComposer: Any Style and Content Image Composition via Feature Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20721v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust, preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Diffusion Models to Efficient 3D LiDAR Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03515v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been applied to 3D LiDAR scene completion due to their strong training stability and high completion quality. However, the slow sampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene completion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of surrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method tailored for 3D Li- DAR scene completion models, dubbed ScoreLiDAR, which achieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. Score- LiDAR enables the distilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To improve completion quality, we also introduce a novel Structural Loss, which encourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D LiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic structure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their relative configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreLiDAR significantly accelerates the completion time from 30.55 to 5.37 seconds per frame (>5x) on SemanticKITTI and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR scene completion models.

In this study, we empirically show that different timesteps of DDIM inversion reveal varying subtle distinctions between synthetic and real images that are extractable for detection, in the forms of such as Fourier power spectrum high-frequency discrepancies and inter-pixel variance distributions. Based on these observations, we propose a novel synthetic image detection method that directly utilizes features of intermediately noised images by training an ensemble on multiple noised timesteps, circumventing conventional reconstruction-based strategies. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce a metric-grounded explanation generation and refinement module to identify and explain AI-generated flaws. Additionally, we construct the GenHard and GenExplain benchmarks to provide detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and challenging samples respectively, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness.

| **[Harnessing Diffusion-Yielded Score Priors for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20590v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges: removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration.</p></details> |  |

First, existing methods depend on 3D training data collected from limited environments, constraining out-of-distribution generalization. The second issue is the difficulty of estimating metric-scale poses from monocular input. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging 2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D motions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose complex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses. We first pretrain a single-view diffusion model on extensive 2D datasets, then fine-tune a multi-view model using public 3D data to enable view-consistent motion generation from monocular input, allowing the model to acquire action priors and diversity through 2D data. Furthermore, to recover absolute poses, we propose a novel human motion representation that decouples the learning of local pose and global movements, while encoding geometric priors of the ground to accelerate convergence. This enables progressive recovery of motion in absolute space during inference. Experimental results on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both camera-space motion realism and world-grounded human positioning, while exhibiting superior generalization capability. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, several critical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network resources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude economy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything communication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we formulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI feedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV communication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint. To this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original long-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm, which innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through extensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing benchmark solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, transactions paper</p></details> |

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models for Global Precipitation Map Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20478v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study, we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models. Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps. Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional systems, inter-user interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models (DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training overhead.</p></details> | 16 pages |

EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization; and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence, higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in contested environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Frequency-Aware Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20454v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm, exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaXsive: High-Capacity and Robust Training-Free Generative Image Watermarking in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21195v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks. Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID) collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions.

The paper develops an empirical application to an experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically relevant parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing 3D Shapes With 64 Latent Vectors for 3D Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08737v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation.

| **[DDB: Diffusion Driven Balancing to Address Spurious Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a Diffusion Driven Balancing (DDB) technique to generate training samples with text-to-image diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArianYp/DDB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-structure Preserved Real-world Image Super-resolution via Transfer VAE Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20291v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model. One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion; however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the 8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning (Vidar), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), Vidar generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

| **[Synomaly Noise and Multi-Stage Diffusion: A Novel Approach for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04004v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in medical imaging plays a crucial role in identifying pathological regions across various imaging modalities, such as brain MRI, liver CT, and carotid ultrasound (US). However, training fully supervised segmentation models is often hindered by the scarcity of expert annotations and the complexity of diverse anatomical structures. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a diffusion model that incorporates a synthetic anomaly (Synomaly) noise function and a multi-stage diffusion process. Synomaly noise introduces synthetic anomalies into healthy images during training, allowing the model to effectively learn anomaly removal. The multi-stage diffusion process is introduced to progressively denoise images, preserving fine details while improving the quality of anomaly-free reconstructions. The generated high-fidelity counterfactual healthy images can further enhance the interpretability of the segmentation models, as well as provide a reliable baseline for evaluating the extent of anomalies and supporting clinical decision-making. Notably, the unsupervised anomaly detection model is trained purely on healthy images, eliminating the need for anomalous training samples and pixel-level annotations. We validate the proposed approach on brain MRI, liver CT datasets, and carotid US. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised segmentation models in the US dataset. Ablation studies further highlight the contributions of Synomaly noise and the multi-stage diffusion process in improving anomaly segmentation. These findings underscore the potential of our approach as a robust and annotation-efficient alternative for medical anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose CopyJudge, a novel automated infringement identification framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework based on the multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide detailed judgment rationales. Based on these judgments, we further introduce a general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing content. Furthermore, assuming the input noise is controllable, our approach can be enhanced by iteratively exploring non-infringing noise vectors within the diffusion latent space, even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our automated identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of infringement, and that our mitigation method more effectively mitigates memorization and IP infringement with a high degree of alignment to the original non-infringing expressions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for industrial applications.

| **[Dual Frequency Branch Framework with Reconstructed Sliding Windows Attention for AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15253v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting significant societal risks, such as misinformation and deception. As a result, detecting AI-generated images has emerged as a critical challenge. Existing researches emphasize extracting fine-grained features to enhance detector generalization, yet they often lack consideration for the importance and interdependencies of internal elements within local regions and are limited to a single frequency domain, hindering the capture of general forgery traces. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we first utilize a sliding window to restrict the attention mechanism to a local window, and reconstruct the features within the window to model the relationships between neighboring internal elements within the local region. Then, we design a dual frequency domain branch framework consisting of four frequency domain subbands of DWT and the phase part of FFT to enrich the extraction of local forgery features from different perspectives. Through feature enrichment of dual frequency domain branches and fine-grained feature extraction of reconstruction sliding window attention, our method achieves superior generalization detection capabilities on both GAN and diffusion model-based generative images. Evaluated on diverse datasets comprising images from 65 distinct generative models, our approach achieves a 2.13\% improvement in detection accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | under review |

However, their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models. MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand design.</p></details> |  |

However, most approaches rely on transformer-based architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block (MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers, and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Beyond symbolic music, SMDIM's architectural design demonstrates adaptability to a broad range of long-sequence generation tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for coherent sequence modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages,3figures |

To address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view, multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models, featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a wide range of downstream tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper, we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics, offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 8 figures, pre-print</p></details> |

In portrait generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

| **[A Lesson in Splats: Teacher-Guided Diffusion for 3D Gaussian Splats Generation with 2D Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00623v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for training 3D image-conditioned diffusion models using only 2D supervision. Recovering 3D structure from 2D images is inherently ill-posed due to the ambiguity of possible reconstructions, making generative models a natural choice. However, most existing 3D generative models rely on full 3D supervision, which is impractical due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. To address this, we propose leveraging sparse-view supervision as a scalable alternative. While recent reconstruction models use sparse-view supervision with differentiable rendering to lift 2D images to 3D, they are predominantly deterministic, failing to capture the diverse set of plausible solutions and producing blurry predictions in uncertain regions. A key challenge in training 3D diffusion models with 2D supervision is that the standard training paradigm requires both the denoising process and supervision to be in the same modality. We address this by decoupling the noisy samples being denoised from the supervision signal, allowing the former to remain in 3D while the latter is provided in 2D. Our approach leverages suboptimal predictions from a deterministic image-to-3D model-acting as a "teacher"-to generate noisy 3D inputs, enabling effective 3D diffusion training without requiring full 3D ground truth. We validate our framework on both object-level and scene-level datasets, using two different 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) teachers. Our results show that our approach consistently improves upon these deterministic teachers, demonstrating its effectiveness in scalable and high-fidelity 3D generative modeling.

With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Papers, project page at http://wenningxu.github.io/multicharacter/</p></details> |

However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose BadPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using BadPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

However, these methods still fail to precisely follow the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task. By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods</p></details> |  |

However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks, DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3figures, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Text-to-Image Generation Via Energy-Based CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17046v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Energy Models (JEMs), while drawing significant research attention, have not been successfully scaled to real-world, high-resolution datasets. We present CLIP-JEM, a novel approach extending JEMs to the multimodal vision-language domain using CLIP, integrating both generative and discriminative objectives. For the generative one, we introduce an image-text joint-energy function based on Cosine similarity in the CLIP space, training CLIP to assign low energy to real image-caption pairs and high energy otherwise. For the discriminative one, we employ contrastive adversarial loss, extending the adversarial training objective to the multimodal domain. CLIP-JEM not only generates realistic images from text but also achieves competitive results on the compositionality benchmark, outperforming leading methods with fewer parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior guidance capability of CLIP-JEM by enhancing CLIP-based generative frameworks and converting unconditional diffusion models to text-based ones. Lastly, we show that our model can serve as a more robust evaluation metric for text-to-image generative tasks than CLIP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically grounded path for materials discovery.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Existing approaches that use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.</p></details> | ICCVW 2025 |
| **[MoFRR: Mixture of Diffusion Models for Face Retouching Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19770v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v7)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

However, given the inherent compositionality of the real world, reliable use of these models in practical applications requires that they exhibit the capability to compose a novel set of concepts to generate outputs not seen in the training data set. Prior work demonstrates that recent diffusion models do exhibit intriguing compositional generalization abilities, but also fail unpredictably. Motivated by this, we perform a controlled study for understanding compositional generalization in conditional diffusion models in a synthetic setting, varying different attributes of the training data and measuring the model's ability to generate samples out-of-distribution. Our results show: (i) the order in which the ability to generate samples from a concept and compose them emerges is governed by the structure of the underlying data-generating process; (ii) performance on compositional tasks exhibits a sudden "emergence" due to multiplicative reliance on the performance of constituent tasks, partially explaining emergent phenomena seen in generative models; and (iii) composing concepts with lower frequency in the training data to generate out-of-distribution samples requires considerably more optimization steps compared to generating in-distribution samples. Overall, our study lays a foundation for understanding capabilities and compositionality in generative models from a data-centric perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>37th ...</summary><p>37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

While existing conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper, we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel, training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025, Project page: https://sinc865.github.io/pino/</p></details> |

In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects, providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.</p></details> |  |

PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Holistic and Lesion Controllable Mammogram Synthesis via Gated Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19201v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework, where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis.

Despite shared architecture and learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally lower fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss) combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing 1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS, SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models, accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Adversarial Point Clouds Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21163v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models, such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models, researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added to the point cloud.</p></details> |  |

However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing.

To this end, we derive a stability framework that is independent of the numerical scheme and introduce a suitable (conforming) reconstruction of the numerical solution. The stability framework relies on some simplifying assumptions that coincide with those made in weak uniqueness results for this system. Additionally, when electrical forces are present, we assume that the solvent concentration is uniformly bounded from below. This is the first a posteriori error estimate for a cross-diffusion system. Along the way, we derive a pointwise a posteriori error estimate for a finite volume scheme that approximates the diffusion equation. We conduct numerical experiments showing that the error estimator scales with the same order as the true error.</p></details> | 27 pages, 2 tables |

Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AEDR: Training-Free AI-Generated Image Attribution via Autoencoder Double-Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18988v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</p></details> |  |

Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce SceneMI, a framework that supports several practical applications, including keyframe-guided character animation in 3D scenes and enhancing the motion quality of imperfect HSI data. SceneMI employs dual scene descriptors to comprehensively encode global and local scene context. Furthermore, our framework leverages the inherent denoising nature of diffusion models to generalize on noisy keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate SceneMI's effectiveness in scene-aware keyframe in-betweening and generalization to the real-world GIMO dataset, where motions and scenes are acquired by noisy IMU sensors and smartphones.

| **[PDT: Point Distribution Transformation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18939v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem. We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines. The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing tasks where structured point distributions are desired.

Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although DiT with 3D VAE has become a standard framework for video generation, it introduces challenges in controllable driving video generation, especially for geometry control, rendering existing control methods ineffective. To address these issues, we propose MagicDrive-V2, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDrive-V2 enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls. Extensive experiments demonstrate MagicDrive-V2's ability, unlocking broader applications in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 camera-ready version, Project Website: https://flymin.github.io/magicdrive-v2/</p></details> |
| **[Neural Correction Operator: A Reliable and Fast Approach for Electrical Impedance Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18875v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that reconstructs electrical conductivity mediums from boundary voltage-current measurements, but its severe ill-posedness renders direct operator learning with neural networks unreliable. We propose the neural correction operator framework, which learns the inverse map as a composition of two operators: a reconstruction operator using L-BFGS optimization with limited iterations to obtain an initial estimate from measurement data and a correction operator implemented with deep learning models to reconstruct the true media from this initial guess. We explore convolutional neural network architectures and conditional diffusion models as alternative choices for the correction operator. We evaluate the neural correction operator by comparing with L-BFGS methods as well as neural operators and conditional diffusion models that directly learn the inverse map over several benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better reconstruction quality compared to both iterative methods and direct neural operator learning methods with the same architecture. The proposed framework also exhibits robustness to measurement noise while achieving substantial computational speedup compared to conventional methods. The neural correction operator provides a general paradigm for approaching neural operator learning in severely ill-posed inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealDeal: Enhancing Realism and Details in Brain Image Generation via Image-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18830v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and texture.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystify Protein Generation with Hierarchical Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18603v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks. However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models. Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels, resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models. Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Distribution Matching for Diffusion Distillation Towards Efficient Image and Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18569v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient image and video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Data-Driven Extended Corresponding State Approach for Residual Property Prediction of Hydrofluoroolefins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21720v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state, the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Torque-based Graph Surgery:Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20031v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks for residential location choice: connection to classical logit models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21334v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap, this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns. Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning in the complex spatial choice contexts.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |

Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast. Code and models are publicly available.</p></details> | Accepted to IROS2025 |

Buildings with similar features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, accepted paper at The Fifth ICDAR International Workshop on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Length and Pruning Experts for Knowledge Graphs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20498v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings, validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.</p></details> |  |

GNN explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers, Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in GNN inference.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this paper, we present Pyg 2.0 (and its subsequent minor versions), a comprehensive update that introduces substantial improvements in scalability and real-world application capabilities. We detail the framework's enhanced architecture, including support for heterogeneous and temporal graphs, scalable feature/graph stores, and various optimizations, enabling researchers and practitioners to tackle large-scale graph learning problems efficiently.

| **[From Observations to Causations: A GNN-based Probabilistic Prediction Framework for Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20349v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training. This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning, with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across various fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Neural Networks Reveal Spatial Domains from Single-cell Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19868v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of spatial clustering of transcriptomics data is of paramount importance. It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Subgraph Matching by Combining Algorithms and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20226v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20147v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) is mainly based on anonymous user interaction sequences to recommend the items that the next user is most likely to click. Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregation-aware MLP: An Unsupervised Approach for Graph Message-passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20127v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms. However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity, especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graded Transformers: A Symbolic-Geometric Approach to Structured Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20108v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT, exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data. We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work. The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Owns This Sample: Cross-Client Membership Inference Attack in Federated Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19964v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups. Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.</p></details> |  |
