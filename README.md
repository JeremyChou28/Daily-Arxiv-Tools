| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at urlhttps://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Developing hybrid mechanistic and data-driven personalized prediction models for platelet dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21204v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematotoxicity, drug-induced damage to the blood-forming system, is a frequent side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy and poses a significant challenge in clinical practice due to its high inter-patient variability and limited predictability. Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks, known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative, we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy, particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14599v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) models can generate high-quality samples from a non-informative prior, but they can be slow, often needing hundreds of network evaluations (NFE). To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |
| **[Crop recommendation with machine learning: leveraging environmental and economic factors for optimal crop selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21201v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agriculture constitutes a primary source of food production, economic growth and employment in India, but the sector is confronted with low farm productivity and yields aggravated by increased pressure on natural resources and adverse climate change variability. Efforts involving green revolution, land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity. However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield, profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19 crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The 10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time. Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation in the Indian context.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[STEB: In Search of the Best Evaluation Approach for Synthetic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21160v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing need for synthetic time series, due to data augmentation or privacy regulations, has led to numerous generative models, frameworks, and evaluation measures alike. Objectively comparing these measures on a large scale remains an open challenge. We propose the Synthetic Time series Evaluation Benchmark (STEB) -- the first benchmark framework that enables comprehensive and interpretable automated comparisons of synthetic time series evaluation measures. Using 10 diverse datasets, randomness injection, and 13 configurable data transformations, STEB computes indicators for measure reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and features sequential and parallel modes of operation. In our experiments, we determine a ranking of 41 measures from literature and confirm that the choice of upstream time series embedding heavily impacts the final score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Memory for Online Interdomain Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08736v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online learning setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (OHSVGP), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SVGP inducing variables to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate OHSVGP with online prediction for 1D time series, continual learning in discriminative GP model for data with multidimensional inputs, and deep generative modeling with sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder, showing that it outperforms existing online GP methods in terms of predictive performance, long-term memory preservation, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Data-Driven And Theory-Driven Modelling - Leveraging Causal Machine Learning for Integrative Modelling of Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09516v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical machine learning techniques often struggle with overfitting and unreliable predictions when exposed to novel conditions. Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing predictive robustness. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data center system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering Black-hat SEO based fake E-commerce scam groups from their redirectors and websites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21021v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While law enforcements agencies and cybercrime researchers are working hard, fake E-commerce scam is still a big threat to Internet users. One of the major techniques to victimize users is luring them by black-hat search-engine-optimization (SEO); making search engines display their lure pages as if these were placed on compromised websites and then redirecting visitors to malicious sites. In this study, we focus on the threat actors conduct fake E-commerce scam with this strategy. Our previous study looked at the connection between some malware families used for black-hat SEO to enlighten threat actors and their infrastructures, however it shows only a limited part of the whole picture because we could not find all SEO malware samples from limited sources. In this paper, we aim to identify and analyze threat actor groups using a large dataset of fake E-commerce sites collected by Japan Cybercrime Control Center, which we believe is of higher quality. It includes 692,865 fake EC sites gathered from redirectors over two and a half years, from May 20, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. We analyzed the links between these sites using Maltego, a well-known link analysis tool, and tailored programs. We also conducted time series analysis to track group changes in the groups. According to the analysis, we estimate that 17 relatively large groups were active during the dataset period and some of them were active throughout the period.</p></details> |  |
| **[shapr: Explaining Machine Learning Models with Conditional Shapley Values in R and Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01842v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the shapr R package, a versatile tool for generating Shapley value based prediction explanations for machine learning and statistical regression models. Moreover, the shaprpy Python library brings the core capabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Shapley values originate from cooperative game theory in the 1950s, but have over the past few years become a widely used method for quantifying how a model's features/covariates contribute to specific prediction outcomes. The shapr package emphasizes conditional Shapley value estimates, providing a comprehensive range of approaches for accurately capturing feature dependencies -- a crucial aspect for correct model explanation, typically lacking in similar software. In addition to regular tabular data, the shapr R package includes specialized functionality for explaining time series forecasts. The package offers a minimal set of user functions with sensible default values for most use cases while providing extensive flexibility for advanced users to fine-tune computations. Additional features include parallelized computations, iterative estimation with convergence detection, and rich visualization tools. shapr also extends its functionality to compute causal and asymmetric Shapley values when causal information is available. Overall, the shapr and shaprpy packages aim to enhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and user-friendly framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20947v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs, there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding, smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401; for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and Galactic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Aware Masked Autoencoders for Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17477v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable accelerometers are widely used for continuous monitoring of physical activity. Supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms have long been used to extract meaningful activity information from raw accelerometry data, but progress has been hampered by the limited amount of labeled data that is publicly available. Exploiting large unlabeled datasets using self-supervised pretraining is a relatively new and underexplored approach in the field of human activity recognition (HAR). We used a time-series transformer masked autoencoder (MAE) approach to self-supervised pretraining and propose two novel spectrogram-based loss functions: the log-scale meanmagnitude (LMM) and log-scale magnitude variance (LMV) losses. We compared these losses with the mean squared error (MSE) loss for MAE training. We leveraged the large unlabeled UK Biobank accelerometry dataset (n = 109k) for pretraining and evaluated downstream HAR performance using a linear classifier in a smaller labelled dataset. We found that pretraining with the LMM loss improved performance compared to an MAE pretrained with the MSE loss, with 12.7% increase in subject-wise F1 score when using linear probing. Compared with a state-of-the-art ResNet-based HAR model, our LMM-pretrained transformer models performed better (+9.8% F1) with linear probing and comparably when fine-tuned using an LSTM classifier. The addition of the LMV to the LMM loss decreased performance compared to the LMM loss alone. These findings establish the LMM loss as a robust and effective method for pretraining MAE models on accelerometer data for HAR and show the potential of pretraining sequence-based models for free-living HAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)</p></details> |
| **[DeepConvContext: A Multi-Scale Approach to Timeseries Classification in Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20894v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows. Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/context_har.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mixture of Low Rank Adaptation with Partial Parameter Sharing for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17872v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework: first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoLA-BC92.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimePro: Efficient Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Variable- and Time-Aware Hyper-state](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20774v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the target variable over distinct time intervals, a challenge known as the multi-delay issue. Traditional models typically process all variables or time points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity. Code is available at https://github.com/xwmaxwma/TimePro.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Robust and Explainable Detector of Time Series Anomaly via Augmenting Multiclass Pseudo-Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20765v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal. However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging. (2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01675v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |
| **[Are Data Embeddings effective in time series forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20716v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications, and numerous complex forecasting models have been proposed in recent years. Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences typically reported between competing models.

The method takes multi-dimensional performance metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system behavior patterns and achieves efficient fault detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Contrastive Learning for Ordinal Engagement Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20676v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Student engagement plays a crucial role in the successful delivery of educational programs. Automated engagement measurement helps instructors monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[BLAST: Balanced Sampling Time Series Corpus for Universal Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17871v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns.

| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via a Parallel Hybridization of ARIMA and Polynomial Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06874v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available under https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning with Expected Signatures: Theory and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20465v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expected signature maps a collection of data streams to a lower dimensional representation, with a remarkable property: the resulting feature tensor can fully characterize the data generating distribution. This "model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates Active Learning (AL) with Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for robust MCP detection. Our method leverages spectral analysis to identify potential changes and employs AL to strategically select new sampling points for improved efficiency. By incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification capabilities of spectral methods, our approach adapts to diverse spectral change behaviors and effectively localizes multiple change points. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and sampling efficiency for non-stationary time series.</p></details> |  |

We used data collected on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than $99\%$ accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $2.58 \pm 0.12$ mm mean distance error. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Generation Under Data Scarcity: A Unified Generative Modeling Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20446v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling of time series is a central challenge in time series analysis, particularly under data-scarce conditions. Despite recent advances in generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets, enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale efficiently across domains.

In this work, we demonstrate how TabPFN-v2, a general tabular foundation model, can be effectively applied to time series forecasting. We introduce TabPFN-TS, a simple method that combines TabPFN-v2 with lightweight feature engineering to enable both point and probabilistic forecasting. Despite its simplicity and compact size (11M parameters), TabPFN-TS achieves top rank on the public GIFT-Eval leaderboard in both forecasting tasks. Through ablation studies, we investigate factors contributing to this surprising effectiveness, especially considering TabPFN-v2 was pretrained solely on synthetic tabular data with no exposure to time series. Our results highlights the potential of tabular foundation models like TabPFN-v2 as a valuable new approach for time series forecasting.

| **[Time-VLM: Exploring Multimodal Vision-Language Models for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04395v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in time series forecasting have explored augmenting models with text or vision modalities to improve accuracy. While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose \method, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.

| **[Synthetic Time Series Forecasting with Transformer Architectures: Extensive Simulation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20048v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing levels of complexity and modeling capacity. We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across model families. To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and complex real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |

Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[Using Time Structure to Estimate Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11076v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist several approaches for estimating causal effects in time series when latent confounding is present. Many of these approaches rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative controls or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in certain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating direct (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup which does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series. This approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving certain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model parameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called full time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely solvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct causal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under which the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus, under which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical experiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages main paper, 30 pages Appendix, 56 pages in total, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v5)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Why Large Language Models Can Be Ineffective in Time Series Analysis: The Impact of Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12326v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in time series analysis and seems to understand the time temporal relationship well than traditional transformer-based approaches. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display "pseudo-alignment" behavior in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Study of Adversarial Robustness Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19397v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale, cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift, posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness. Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of TSFMs.</p></details> | Preprint |

Due to their multidimensional nature, time series often need to be embedded into a fixed-dimensional feature space to enable processing with various machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and quantitative evaluation of time series embedding methods for effective representations in machine learning and deep learning models. We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

The Black-Litterman model offers a powerful Bayesian approach to adjust equilibrium returns using investor views to form a posterior expectation along with market priors. Mainstream research mainly generates subjective views through statistical models or machine learning methods, among which hybrid models combined with decomposition algorithms perform well. However, most hybrid models do not pay enough attention to noise, and time series decomposition methods based on single variables make it difficult to fully utilize information between multiple variables. Multivariate decomposition also has problems of low efficiency and poor component quality. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid forecasting model SSA-MAEMD-TCN to automate and improve the view generation process. The proposed model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for denoising, Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD) for frequency-aligned decomposition, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for deep sequence learning to capture complex temporal patterns across multiple financial indicators. Empirical tests on the Nasdaq 100 Index stocks show a significant improvement in forecasting performance compared to baseline models based on MAEMD and MEMD. The optimized portfolio performs well, with annualized returns and Sharpe ratios far exceeding those of the traditional portfolio over a short holding period, even after accounting for transaction costs.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and 21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.</p></details> |  |

However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both accurate and efficient forecasting.

| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v6)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has become a critical approach in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily for its capacity to expand training datasets, enhance model robustness, introduce diversity, and reduce overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Conditioned on an ECG and a textual query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology, identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans. To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources. Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works, three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next generation of ELMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Traditional Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model, combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy systems in smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)</p></details> |

The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)</p></details> |
| **[Variational SchrÃ¶dinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v5)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

These situations are damaging livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. This study uses the Kabul River between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a case study to reflect the complications of flood forecasting in transboundary basins. The challenges in obtaining upstream data impede the efficacy of flood control measures and early warning systems, a common global problem in similar basins. Utilizing satellite-based climatic data, this study applied numerous advanced machine-learning and deep learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict daily and multi-step river flow. The LSTM network outperformed other models, achieving the highest R2 value of 0.96 and the lowest RMSE value of 140.96 m3/sec. The time series LSTM and GRU network models, utilized for short-term forecasts of up to five days, performed significantly. However, the accuracy declined beyond the fourth day, highlighting the need for longer-term historical datasets for reliable long-term flood predictions. The results of the study are directly aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, 13, and 15, facilitating disaster and water management, timely evacuations, improved preparedness, and effective early warning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figure |

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

However, limited data availability during emerging outbreaks and the complex interaction between environmental factors and disease dynamics present significant challenges for effective forecasting. In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |

Although increasingly powerful models have been developed and achieved superior results on benchmark datasets, through a fine-grained sample-level inspection, we find that (i) no single model consistently outperforms others across different test samples, but instead (ii) each model excels in specific cases. These findings prompt us to explore how to adaptively leverage the distinct strengths of various forecasting models for different samples. We introduce TimeFuse, a framework for collective time-series forecasting with sample-level adaptive fusion of heterogeneous models. TimeFuse utilizes meta-features to characterize input time series and trains a learnable fusor to predict optimal model fusion weights for any given input. The fusor can leverage samples from diverse datasets for joint training, allowing it to adapt to a wide variety of temporal patterns and thus generalize to new inputs, even from unseen datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeFuse in various long-/short-term forecasting tasks, achieving near-universal improvement over the state-of-the-art individual models.

Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/). Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled). Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format. Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy. By enabling more accurate motion management and adaptive treatment strategies, this dataset has the potential to advance the field of radiotherapy significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables; submitted to Medical Physics, tentatively accepted</p></details> |

We present PMOA-TTS, the first openly available dataset of 124,699 PubMed Open Access (PMOA) case reports, each converted into structured (event, time) timelines via a scalable LLM-based pipeline. Our approach combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1, resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task, embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices up to 0.82 $\pm$ 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline extraction, temporal reasoning, and longitudinal modeling in biomedical NLP.

| **[Decomposition of Water Demand Patterns Using Skewed Gaussian Distributions for Behavioral Insights and Operational Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18245v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel approach for decomposing urban water demand patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to derive behavioral insights and support operational planning. Hourly demand profiles contain critical information for both long-term infrastructure design and daily operations, influencing network pressures, water quality, energy consumption, and overall reliability. By breaking down each daily demand curve into a baseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method characterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak amplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby reconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This detailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g. anomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic analyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy impacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or purely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak shapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the fidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of irregular consumption behavior. The method is demonstrated on several real-world datasets, showing that SGD outperforms symmetric Gaussian models in reconstruction accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error by over 50% on average, while maintaining physical interpretability. The SGD framework can also be used to construct synthetic demand scenarios by designing daily peak profiles with chosen characteristics.

Recent WF attacks built using machine learning (and deep learning) process and summarize trace metadata during their feature extraction phases. This methodology leads to predictions that lack information about the instant at which a given website is detected within a (potentially large) network trace comprised of multiple sequential website accesses -- a setting known as \textit{multi-tab} WF. In this paper, we explore whether classical time series analysis techniques can be effective in the WF setting. Specifically, we introduce TSA-WF, a pipeline designed to closely preserve network traces' timing and direction characteristics, which enables the exploration of algorithms designed to measure time series similarity in the WF context. Our evaluation with Tor traces reveals that TSA-WF achieves a comparable accuracy to existing WF attacks in scenarios where website accesses can be easily singled-out from a given trace (i.e., the \textit{single-tab} WF setting), even when shielded by specially designed WF defenses. Finally, while TSA-WF did not outperform existing attacks in the multi-tab setting, we show how TSA-WF can help pinpoint the approximate instant at which a given website of interest is visited within a multi-tab trace.\footnote{This preprint has not undergone any post-submission improvements or corrections.

These systems must be embedded into the surrounding environment, capable of capturing activity, and responding promptly. This paper presents a low-cost, privacy-preserving solution using Passive Infrared (PIR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to track entries, sitting, exits, and emergency scenarios within a home bathroom setting. We developed and evaluated a rule-based detection system through five real-world experiments simulating elderly behavior. Annotated time-series graphs demonstrate the system's ability to detect dangerous states, such as motionless collapses, while maintaining privacy through non-visual sensing.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Since there is only one Jumbo token, its cost is minimal, and because we share this FFN across layers, its parameter count is controlled. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. These gains are largest at small sizes / high speeds, e.g., ViT-nano+Jumbo outperforms ViT-nano+Registers by 13%. In fact, our Jumbo models are so efficient that they outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs, such as support for token dropping and other modalities. Accordingly, we demonstrate that Jumbo excels in these two settings via masked autoencoding and on a suite of time series benchmarks.

Nowadays machine learning (ML) is being leveraged in healthcare ubiquitously. In recent years, management of ICU became one of the most significant parts of the hospital functionality (largely but not only due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). This study explores multiple ML approaches for predicting LOS in ICU specifically for the patients with neurological diseases based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The evaluated models include classic ML algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) and Neural Networks (LSTM, BERT and Temporal Fusion Transformer). Given that LOS prediction is often framed as a classification task, this study categorizes LOS into three groups: less than two days, less than a week, and a week or more. As the first ML-based approach targeting LOS prediction for neurological disorder patients, this study does not aim to outperform existing methods but rather to assess their effectiveness in this specific context. The findings provide insights into the applicability of ML techniques for improving ICU resource management and patient care. According to the results, Random Forest model proved to outperform others on static, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, a precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.67. While BERT model outperformed LSTM model on time-series data with an accuracy of 0.80, a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.80 and F1-score 0.80.</p></details> |  |

This success is attributed to their strong representation capabilities. However, due to the inherent variability in TS data, these models often struggle with generalization and robustness. To address this, a common approach is to perform Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, particularly Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), to handle domain shifts and emerging novel classes. While extensively studied in computer vision, UniDA remains underexplored for TS data. This work provides a comprehensive implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art TS backbones in a UniDA framework. We propose a reliable protocol to evaluate their robustness and generalization across different domains. The goal is to provide practitioners with a framework that can be easily extended to incorporate future advancements in UniDA and TS architectures. Our results highlight the critical influence of backbone selection in UniDA performance and enable a robustness analysis across various datasets and architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecasting models.

The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh--Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4 and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh--Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the state-of-the-art performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system.

| **[TimeCF: A TimeMixer-Based Model with adaptive Convolution and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss for long-term time seris forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17532v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that by introducing prior knowledge, multi-scale analysis of complex and non-stationary time series in real environments can achieve good results in the field of long-term forecasting. However, affected by channel-independent methods, models based on multi-scale analysis may produce suboptimal prediction results due to the autocorrelation between time series labels, which in turn affects the generalization ability of the model. To address this challenge, we are inspired by the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and the recently proposed FreDF method and design a deep learning model TimeCF for long-term time series forecasting based on the TimeMixer, combined with our designed adaptive convolution information aggregation module and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss (SAMFre). Specifically, TimeCF first decomposes the original time series into sequences of different scales. Next, the same-sized convolution modules are used to adaptively aggregate information of different scales on sequences of different scales. Then, decomposing each sequence into season and trend parts and the two parts are mixed at different scales through bottom-up and top-down methods respectively. Finally, different scales are aggregated through a Feed-Forward Network. What's more, extensive experimental results on different real-world datasets show that our proposed TimeCF has excellent performance in the field of long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The recent increase in river-discharged nitrate poses a major risk for coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Although nitrate is an optically inactive (i.e., colourless) constituent, previous studies have demonstrated there is an indirect, non-causal relationship between water surface nitrate and water-leaving reflectance that is mediated through optically active water quality parameters such as total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter. This work aims to advance our understanding of this relationship with an effort to measure time-series nitrate and simultaneous hyperspectral reflectance at the Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia. Time-series observations revealed periodic cycles in nitrate loads due to the tidal influence in the estuarine study site. The water surface nitrate loads were predicted from hyperspectral reflectance and water salinity measurements, with hyperspectral reflectance indicating the concentrations of optically active variables and salinity indicating the mixing of river water and seawater proportions. The accuracy assessment of model-predicted nitrate against in-situ measured nitrate values showed that the predicted nitrate values correlated well with the ground-truth data, with an $R^2$ score of 0.86, and an RMSE of 0.03 mg/L. This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting water surface nitrate from hyperspectral reflectance and salinity measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IGARSS2025</p></details> |

Many existing IMTS models either require padded samples to learn separately from temporal and variable dimensions, or represent original samples via bipartite graphs or sets. However, the former approaches often need to handle extra padding values affecting efficiency and disrupting original sampling patterns, while the latter ones have limitations in capturing dependencies among unaligned observations. To represent and learn both dependencies from original observations in a unified form, we propose HyperIMTS, a Hypergraph neural network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Observed values are converted as nodes in the hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable hyperedges to enable message passing among all observations. Through irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS captures variable dependencies in a time-adaptive way to achieve accurate forecasting. Experiments demonstrate HyperIMTS's competitive performance among state-of-the-art models in IMTS forecasting with low computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, it faces fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing 863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand underestimation from 7.37% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code (https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

A common goal in analyzing time series data is to understand the underlying events that cause the observed variations. We conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer events described with natural language from time series data. We evaluate 18 LLMs on a task to match event sequences with real-valued time series data using a new benchmark we develop using sports data. Several current LLMs demonstrate promising abilities, with OpenAI's o1 performing the best but with DS-R1-distill-Qwen-32B outperforming proprietary models such as GPT-4o. From insights derived from analyzing reasoning failures, we also find clear avenues to improve performance. By applying post-training optimizations, i.e., distillation and self-improvement, we significantly enhance the performance of the Qwen2.5 1.5B, achieving results second only to o1. All resources needed to reproduce our work are available: https://github.com/BennyTMT/GAMETime</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 Figures |
| **[Enhancing Channel-Independent Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Variate Patch Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12761v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added link to code implementation in PDF abstract</p></details> |

We introduce a versatile wavelet probabilistic module designed to extract and analyse the probabilistic features, which can seamlessly integrate with a variety of neural network architectures. This probabilistic module comprises an Adaptive Wavelet Probabilistic Feature Generator (AWPG) and a Channel Attention-based Probabilistic Temporal Convolutional Network (APTCN). Such formulation extends the application of wavelet probabilistic neural networks to deep neural networks for MTSC. The AWPG constructs an ensemble probabilistic model addressing different data scarcities and non-stationarity; it adaptively selects the optimal ones and generates probabilistic features for APTCN. The APTCN analyses the correlations of the features and forms a comprehensive feature space with existing MTSC models for classification. Here, we instantiate the proposed module to work in parallel with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Causal Fully Convolutional Network (C-FCN), demonstrating its broad applicability in time series analysis. The WPRCN is evaluated on 30 diverse MTS datasets and outperforms all the benchmark algorithms on average accuracy and rank, exhibiting pronounced strength in handling scarce data and physiological data subject to perturbations and non-stationarities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order approximation for uncertainty quantification in time series analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01108v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For time series with high temporal correlation, the empirical process converges rather slowly to its limiting distribution. Many statistics in change-point analysis, goodness-of-fit testing and uncertainty quantification admit a representation as functionals of the empirical process and therefore inherit its slow convergence. As a result, inference based on the asymptotic distribution of those quantities is significantly affected by relatively small sample sizes. We assess the quality of higher-order approximations of the empirical process by deriving the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding error terms. Based on the limiting distribution of the higher-order terms, we propose a novel approach to calculate confidence intervals for statistical quantities such as the median. In a simulation study, we compare coverage rates and lengths of these confidence intervals with those based on the asymptotic distribution of the empirical process and highlight some benefits of higher-order approximations of the empirical process.</p></details> |  |

Currently, there is no existing movement model that can be used to describe full year of migratory species data that leverages both individual movement data and species distribution data. Herein we propose a full-year stochastic differential equation model for jointly modeling both individual movement data and species distribution data. We show that this joint model, under certain assumptions, results in efficient computation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the entire population, and thus provides straightforward inference on the species distribution data. We illustrate this model with 215 bird-years of golden eagle movement in western North America and data from eBird for the species distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoliTom: Holistic Token Merging for Fast Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21334v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[MME-VideoOCR: Evaluating OCR-Based Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs in Video Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21333v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefAV: Towards Planning-Centric Scenario Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20981v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CainanD/RefAV/ and https://argoverse.github.io/user-guide/tasks/scenario_mining.html</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Spiking Neural Networks for Unified Frame-Event Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20834v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,6 figures,4 tables</p></details> |

Previous work on modeling the strategies of air traffic controllers and their mental image of traffic situations often centers on specific air traffic control tasks or pairwise interactions between aircraft, neglecting to capture the comprehensive dynamics of an air traffic situation. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for explaining air traffic situations. Specifically, we employ a Transformer-based multi-agent trajectory model that encapsulates both the spatio-temporal movement of aircraft and social interaction between them. By deriving attention scores from the model, we can quantify the influence of individual aircraft on overall traffic dynamics. This provides explainable insights into how air traffic controllers perceive and understand the traffic situation. Trained on real-world air traffic surveillance data collected from the terminal airspace around Incheon International Airport in South Korea, our framework effectively explicates air traffic situations. This could potentially support and enhance the decision-making and situational awareness of air traffic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, minor revisions to address reviewer feedback for final submission to the First US-Europe Air Transportation Research and Development (ATRD) Symposium</p></details> |

TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera movement is effectively canceled out. Within this stabilized 3D representation, TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame motion estimates, enabling robust point tracking over long time horizons. To handle the irregular structure of 3D point distributions, we propose a 3D Neighborhood-to-Neighborhood (N2N) attention mechanism - a 3D-aware contextualization strategy that builds informative, spatially coherent feature neighborhoods to support precise trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric formulation significantly improves performance over existing 3D point tracking methods and even surpasses state-of-the-art 2D pixel trackers in accuracy when reliable depth is available. The model supports inference in both camera-centric (unstabilized) and world-centric (stabilized) coordinates, with experiments showing that compensating for camera motion leads to substantial gains in tracking robustness. By replacing the conventional 2D square correlation windows used in prior 2D and 3D trackers with a spatially grounded 3D attention mechanism, TAPIP3D achieves strong and consistent results across multiple 3D point tracking benchmarks.

However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Models that employ the exceedances of values above suitably selected high thresholds possess the advantage of capturing the "sub-asymptotic" dependence of data. This paper presents an extension of spatial random scale mixture models to the spatio-temporal domain. A comprehensive framework for characterizing the dependence structure of extreme events across both dimensions is provided. Indeed, the model is capable of distinguishing between asymptotic dependence and independence, both in space and time, through the use of parametric inference. The high complexity of the likelihood function for the proposed model necessitates a simulation approach based on neural networks for parameter estimation, which leverages summaries of the sub-asymptotic dependence present in the data. The effectiveness of the model in assessing the limiting dependence structure of spatio-temporal processes is demonstrated through both simulation studies and an application to rainfall datasets.</p></details> |  |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

These tracking data can be used to calibrate mathematical models of individual motility. However, experimental data is intrinsically discrete and noisy, and complicating the calibration of models for individual motion. We consider motion of individual agents that can be described by velocity-jump models in one spatial dimension. These agents transition according to a Poisson process between an n-state network, in which each state is associated with a fixed velocity and fixed rates of switching to every other state. Exploiting an approximate solution to the resultant stochastic process, in this work we develop a corresponding Bayesian inference framework to calibrate these models to discrete-time noisy data. We first demonstrate the ability of our framework to effectively recover the model parameters of data simulated from two-state and three-state models. Moreover, we use the framework to select between three-state models with distinct networks of states. Finally, we explore the question of model selection by calibrating three-state and four-state models to data simulated from a number of different four-state models. Overall, the framework works effectively and efficiently in calibrating and selecting between velocity-jump models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 supplementary figures</p></details> |

While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Depth-based perception approaches often struggle with sensor noise, lighting variability, computational overhead from intermediate representations (e.g., elevation maps), and difficulties with non-planar obstacles, limiting performance in unstructured environments. In contrast, direct integration of LiDAR sensing into end-to-end learning for legged locomotion remains underexplored. We propose Omni-Perception, an end-to-end locomotion policy that achieves 3D spatial awareness and omnidirectional collision avoidance by directly processing raw LiDAR point clouds. At its core is PD-RiskNet (Proximal-Distal Risk-Aware Hierarchical Network), a novel perception module that interprets spatio-temporal LiDAR data for environmental risk assessment. To facilitate efficient policy learning, we develop a high-fidelity LiDAR simulation toolkit with realistic noise modeling and fast raycasting, compatible with platforms such as Isaac Gym, Genesis, and MuJoCo, enabling scalable training and effective sim-to-real transfer. Learning reactive control policies directly from raw LiDAR data enables the robot to navigate complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles more robustly than approaches relying on intermediate maps or limited sensing. We validate Omni-Perception through real-world experiments and extensive simulation, demonstrating strong omnidirectional avoidance capabilities and superior locomotion performance in highly dynamic environments. We will open-source our code and models.</p></details> |  |

This work presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices, PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency. As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IBPRIA 2025 Conference in Coimbra, Portugal</p></details> |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn, spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on standard visual understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins, the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are made available open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPDEBench: An Extensive Benchmark for Learning Regular and Singular Stochastic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18511v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics. To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.</p></details> |  |

Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.

| **[Bruno: Backpropagation Running Undersampled for Novel device Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17791v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning systems have focused on the development of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which provide hardware specialized for the deployment of neural networks, leading to potential gains in efficiency and performance. These systems typically feature an architecture that goes beyond the von Neumann architecture employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs. Neural networks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account the specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training algorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and synapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching non-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common approach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse models, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to model the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a training algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these physical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as stochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is then tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized synapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF) neurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks composed of LIF neurons. The results of the experiments show the potential advantage of using BRUNO to train networks with FeLIF neurons, by achieving a reduction in both time and memory for detecting spatio-temporal patterns with quantized synapses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 pages supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVL: Spike-based Vision-language Pretraining for Efficient 3D Open-world Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17674v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment (MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration (Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D classification (+6.1%), DVS action recognition (+2.1%), 3D detection (+1.1%), and 3D segmentation (+2.1%) with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, SVL enables SNNs to perform open-world 3D question answering, sometimes outperforming ANNs. To the best of our knowledge, SVL represents the first scalable, generalizable, and hardware-friendly paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, effectively bridging the gap between SNNs and ANNs in complex open-world understanding tasks.

While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |

FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing.

Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics, visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 8 figures, CVPR 2025 Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Satellite images enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of spatio-temporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The paper includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, which highlight the potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource forecasting.

Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

| **[Temporal and Spatial Feature Fusion Framework for Dynamic Micro Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16372v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques, with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network (RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary "where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary state-of-the-art methods.

However, due to the misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp, achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves 65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.</p></details> |  |

However, this procedure often requires high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery, achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers' equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

While existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval, segmentation, and object detection to reason about previously unseen objects and interpret natural language queries.

This study investigates whether embeddings from large-scale, self-supervised language and speech models can effectively reconstruct high-gamma neural activity characteristics, key indicators of cortical processing, recorded during speech production. We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto these high-gamma signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. Reconstructed neural signals are evaluated against high-gamma ground-truth activity using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that high-gamma activity can be effectively reconstructed using large language and speech model embeddings in all study participants, generating Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Interspeech2025</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to 3.8% on LongVideoBench, 4.1% on VideoMME, and 4.0% on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Deformable drones, which can adapt their shape in real-time, offer a promising solution to overcome these challenges, while also enhancing maneuverability and enabling novel tasks like object grasping. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous motion planning and control for deformable quadrotors. We introduce a shape-adaptive trajectory planner that incorporates deformation dynamics into path generation, using a scalable kinodynamic A* search to handle deformation parameters in complex environments. The backend spatio-temporal optimization is capable of generating optimally smooth trajectories that incorporate shape deformation. Additionally, we propose an enhanced control strategy that compensates for external forces and torque disturbances, achieving a 37.3\% reduction in trajectory tracking error compared to our previous work. Our approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in narrow-gap traversal and multi-modal deformable tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12214v6)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operation of water distribution networks simply aims at efficiently delivering consumers adequate water while maintaining safe water quality (WQ). However, this process entails a multi-scale interplay between hydraulic and WQ dynamics evolving spatio-temporally within such a complex infrastructure network. While prior research has addressed the hydraulic optimization problem and WQ regulation as decoupled or coupled, they often overlook control-theoretic guided solutions. This paper takes a novel approach by investigating the coupling between hydraulic and WQ dynamics from a control networks perspective. We propose a quality-aware control framework that embeds WQ controllability metrics into the network-level pump scheduling problem, acknowledging the direct influence of system hydraulics on WQ controller behavior. We examine the trade-offs between pump control energy cost and WQ performance across various network sizes and scenarios. Our results showcase how network topology, hydraulic constraints, and WQ metrics jointly impact optimal pump schedules and, accordingly, the achievable level of WQ regulation, offering insights into designing efficient control strategies for water infrastructure networks governed by interdependent dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[Energy-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14533v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks. However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning. In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL) algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed. Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world decision-making scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTVCrafter: 4D Motion Tokenization for Open-World Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10238v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code are on: https://github.com/DINGYANB/MTVCrafter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni4D: A Unified Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Point Cloud Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04837v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud videos remains a challenging problem with two key limitations: (1) existing methods rely on explicit knowledge to learn motion, resulting in suboptimal representations; (2) prior Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) frameworks struggle to bridge the gap between low-level geometry and high-level dynamics in 4D data. In this work, we propose a novel self-disentangled MAE for learning expressive, discriminative, and transferable 4D representations. To overcome the first limitation, we learn motion by aligning high-level semantics in the latent space \textit{without any explicit knowledge}. To tackle the second, we introduce a \textit{self-disentangled learning} strategy that incorporates the latent token with the geometry token within a shared decoder, effectively disentangling low-level geometry and high-level semantics. In addition to the reconstruction objective, we employ three alignment objectives to enhance temporal understanding, including frame-level motion and video-level global information. We show that our pre-trained encoder surprisingly discriminates spatio-temporal representation without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on MSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both coarse-grained and fine-grained 4D downstream tasks. Notably, Uni4D improves action segmentation accuracy on HOI4D by $+3.8\%$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods rely on pose priors for motion control, resulting in limited motion diversity and continuity in details. To address this, we propose a framework that generates volumetric 4D sequences, where 3D shapes are animated under given conditions (text-image guidance) with dynamic evolution in shape and color across spatial and temporal dimensions, allowing for free navigation and rendering from any direction. We first use a coherent 3D shape and color modeling to encode the shape and color of each detailed 3D geometry frame into a latent space. Then we propose a matrixized 4D sequence representation allowing efficient diffusion model operation. Finally, we introduce spatio-temporal diffusion for 4D volumetric generation under given images and text prompts. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, 3DBiCar, DeformingThings4D and Objaverse datasets for several tasks demonstrate that our method effectively learns to generate high quality 3D shapes with consistent color and coherent mesh animations, improving over the current methods. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment in Modular Construction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13278v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular construction, involving off-site prefabrication and on-site assembly, offers significant advantages but presents complex coordination challenges for robotic automation. Effective task allocation is critical for leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) in these structured environments. This paper introduces the Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment (HVBTA) framework, a novel approach to optimizing collaboration between heterogeneous multi-agent construction teams. Inspired by human reasoning in task delegation, HVBTA uniquely integrates multiple voting mechanisms with the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced suitability assessment between agent capabilities and task requirements. The framework operates by assigning Capability Profiles to agents and detailed requirement lists called Task Descriptions to construction tasks, subsequently generating a quantitative Suitability Matrix. Six distinct voting methods, augmented by a pre-trained LLM, analyze this matrix to robustly identify the optimal agent for each task. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is integrated for decentralized, collision-free path planning, ensuring efficient and safe spatio-temporal coordination of the robotic team during assembly operations. HVBTA enables efficient, conflict-free assignment and coordination, facilitating potentially faster and more accurate modular assembly. Current work is evaluating HVBTA's performance across various simulated construction scenarios involving diverse robotic platforms and task complexities. While designed as a generalizable framework for any domain with clearly definable tasks and capabilities, HVBTA will be particularly effective for addressing the demanding coordination requirements of multi-agent collaborative robotics in modular construction due to the predetermined construction planning involved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Block by Block workshop at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Frequency-Based Attention Cache Memory Model for Real-Time Speech Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13094v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM) model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage. In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters.

| **[Scene-Text Grounding for Text-Based Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14319v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decisionmaking and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study Grounded TextVideoQA by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scenetext recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, e.g., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset ViTXT-GQA which features 52K scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2K temporal segments related to 2K questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition. To advance the research of Grounded TextVideoQA, our dataset and code are at https://github.com/zhousheng97/ViTXT-GQA.git</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM |

While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of LLMs.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoVer: Motion Verification for Motion Graphics Animations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13372v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. We introduce MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. We identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). We implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. We then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation. To evaluate our pipeline, we build a synthetic dataset of 5600 text prompts paired with ground truth MoVer verification programs. We find that while our LLM-based pipeline is able to automatically generate a correct motion graphics animation for 58.8% of the test prompts without any iteration, this number raises to 93.6% with up to 50 correction iterations. Our code and dataset are at https://mover-dsl.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Robust Optimization with Data-Driven Uncertainty for Enhancing Distribution System Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11627v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are placing growing strain on electric power systems, exposing the limitations of purely reactive responses and prompting the need for proactive resilience planning. However, existing approaches often rely on simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions, overlooking their critical interdependence. This paper proposes a novel tri-level optimization framework that integrates proactive infrastructure investment, adversarial modeling of spatio-temporal disruptions, and adaptive reactive response. We construct high-probability, distribution-free uncertainty sets using conformal prediction to capture complex and data-scarce outage patterns. To solve the resulting nested decision problem, we derive a bi-level reformulation via strong duality and develop a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods, achieving lower worst-case losses and more efficient resource allocation, especially under tight operational constraints and large-scale uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems are computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoFace: Emotion-Content Disentangled Speech-Driven 3D Talking Face Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11518v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of increasingly vivid 3D talking face has become a hot topic in recent years. Currently, most speech-driven works focus on lip synchronisation but neglect to effectively capture the correlations between emotions and facial motions. To address this problem, we propose a two-stream network called EmoFace, which consists of an emotion branch and a content branch. EmoFace employs a novel Mesh Attention mechanism to analyse and fuse the emotion features and content features. Particularly, a newly designed spatio-temporal graph-based convolution, SpiralConv3D, is used in Mesh Attention to learn potential temporal and spatial feature dependencies between mesh vertices. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce a new self-growing training scheme with intermediate supervision to dynamically adjust the ratio of groundtruth adopted in the 3D face animation task. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on our high-quality 3D emotional facial animation dataset, 3D-RAVDESS ($4.8863\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.9509\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), together with the public dataset VOCASET ($2.8669\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.4664\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal discovery on vector-valued variables and consistency-guided aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10476v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery (CD) aims to discover the causal graph underlying the data generation mechanism of observed variables. In many real-world applications, the observed variables are vector-valued, such as in climate science where variables are defined over a spatial grid and the task is called spatio-temporal causal discovery. We motivate CD in vector-valued variable setting while considering different possibilities for the underlying model, and highlight the pitfalls of commonly-used approaches when compared to a fully vectorized approach. Furthermore, often the vector-valued variables are high-dimensional, and aggregations of the variables, such as averages, are considered in interest of efficiency and robustness. In the absence of interventional data, testing for the soundness of aggregate variables as consistent abstractions that map a low-level to a high-level structural causal model (SCM) is hard, and recent works have illustrated the stringency of conditions required for testing consistency. In this work, we take a careful look at the task of vector-valued CD via constraint-based methods, focusing on the problem of consistency of aggregation for this task. We derive three aggregation consistency scores, based on compatibility of independence models and (partial) aggregation, that quantify different aspects of the soundness of an aggregation map for the CD problem. We present the argument that the consistency of causal abstractions must be separated from the task-dependent consistency of aggregation maps. As an actionable conclusion of our findings, we propose a wrapper Adag to optimize a chosen aggregation consistency score for aggregate-CD, to make the output of CD over aggregate variables more reliable. We supplement all our findings with experimental evaluations on synthetic non-time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times. Code is available at:https://github.com/fchest/ListenNet.</p></details> |  |

It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatio-temporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at ICRA 2025 conference.

| **[Unified theory for joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v9)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGRec: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Federated Graph Learning for Secure and Efficient Cross-Border Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18177v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing, collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge. Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy, FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: Leveraging the Language of Soccer to Improve Spatio-Temporal Action Detection in Broadcast Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09455v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

In this respect, traditional ANOVA-based studies and linear mixed effects models typically provide only limited exploration of the dynamic of the group brain activity and variability of the individual responses potentially leading to overly simplistic conclusions and/or missing more intricate patterns. In this study we propose a novel Bayesian model-based clustering method for functional data to simultaneously assess group effects and individual deviations over the most important temporal features in the data. To this aim, we develop an innovative multilevel partition prior to model the functional scores of a functional Principal Components decomposition of neuroscientific recordings; this approach returns a thorough exploration of group differences and individual deviations without compromising on the spatio-temporal nature of the data. By means of a simulation study we demonstrate that the proposed model returns correct classification in different clustering scenarios under low and high noise levels in the data. Finally we consider a case study using Electroencephalogram data recorded during an object recognition task where our approach provides new insights into the underlying brain mechanisms generating the data and their variability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added clarifications and additional comments throughout.

We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered signifi-cant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public en-gagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets-often politically or virally motivated-pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel da-taset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture that integrates spatio-temporal motion features from a 3D ResNeXt-101 backbone and static visual semantics from CLIP. The two streams are fused via an attention-based mechanism, while co-attention modules refine the visual, textual, and audio features for effective multi-modal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generali-zation capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detec-tion efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for de-tecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing meth-odologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |

Our approach introduces finite-horizon hierarchical factorization, a framework that plans one step at a time in a receding-horizon fashion. Robots first compute individual plans in parallel, and then dynamically group based on spatio-temporal conflicts and reachability. The framework accounts for conflict resolution, and for immediate execution and concurrent planning, significantly reducing response time compared to offline algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark maps demonstrate that our method achieves up to 60% reduction in time-to-first-action while consistently delivering high-quality solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art offline baselines across a range of problem sizes and planning horizons.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

Currently, materials experts mainly rely on conventional desktop-based systems using 2D visualisation techniques, which render respective analyses a time-consuming and mentally demanding challenge. MARV is a novel immersive visual analytics system, which makes analyses of such data more effective and engaging in an augmented reality setting. For this purpose, MARV includes three newly designed visualisation techniques: MDD Glyphs with a Skewness Kurtosis Mapper, Temporal Evolution Tracker, and Chrono Bins, facilitating interactive exploration and comparison of multidimensional distributions of attribute data from multiple time steps. A qualitative evaluation conducted with materials experts in a real-world case study demonstrates the benefits of the proposed visualisation techniques. This evaluation revealed that combining spatial and abstract data in an immersive environment improves their analytical capabilities and facilitates the identification of patterns, anomalies, as well as changes over time.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

In the era of big Earth observation data ubiquity, attempts have been made to accurately detect crop phenology using Remote Sensing (RS) and high resolution weather data. However, most studies have focused on large scale predictions of phenology or developed methods which are not adequate to help crop modeler communities on leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinal-2 data and fusing them with high resolution climate data, using a novel framework. For this, we trained a Machine Learning (ML) LightGBM model to predict 13 phenological stages for eight major crops across Germany at 20 m scale. Observed phonologies were taken from German national phenology network (German Meteorological Service; DWD) between 2017 and 2021. We proposed a thorough feature selection analysis to find the best combination of RS and climate data to detect phenological stages. At national scale, predicted phenology resulted in a reasonable precision of R2 > 0.43 and a low Mean Absolute Error of 6 days, averaged over all phenological stages and crops. The spatio-temporal analysis of the model predictions demonstrates its transferability across different spatial and temporal context of Germany. The results indicated that combining radar sensors with climate data yields a very promising performance for a multitude of practical applications. Moreover, these improvements are expected to be useful to generate highly valuable input for crop model calibrations and evaluations, facilitate informed agricultural decisions, and contribute to sustainable food production to address the increasing global food demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[NetSight: Graph Attention Based Traffic Forecasting in Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07034v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic in today's networks is increasingly influenced by the interactions among network nodes as well as by the temporal fluctuations in the demands of the nodes. Traditional statistical prediction methods are becoming obsolete due to their inability to address the non-linear and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies present in today's network traffic. The most promising direction of research today is graph neural networks (GNNs) based prediction approaches that are naturally suited to handle graph-structured data. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art GNN approaches separate the modeling of spatial and temporal information, resulting in the loss of important information about joint dependencies. These GNN based approaches further do not model information at both local and global scales simultaneously, leaving significant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose NetSight. NetSight learns joint spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously at both global and local scales from the time-series of measurements of any given network metric collected at various nodes in a network. Using the learned information, NetSight can then accurately predict the future values of the given network metric at those nodes in the network. We propose several new concepts and techniques in the design of NetSight, such as spatio-temporal adjacency matrix and node normalization. Through extensive evaluations and comparison with prior approaches using data from two large real-world networks, we show that NetSight significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the source code and data used in the evaluation of NetSight on the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |

Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by generating a compact synthetic dataset that retains the essential information from a large real dataset. However, existing methods often suffer from limited performance and poor data quality, particularly in the video domain. In this paper, we focus on video dataset distillation by employing a video diffusion model to generate high-quality synthetic videos. To enhance representativeness, we introduce Video Spatio-Temporal U-Net (VST-UNet), a model designed to select a diverse and informative subset of videos that effectively captures the characteristics of the original dataset. To further optimize computational efficiency, we explore a training-free clustering algorithm, Temporal-Aware Cluster-based Distillation (TAC-DT), to select representative videos without requiring additional training overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating performance improvements of up to \(10.61\%\) over the state-of-the-art. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets, establishing a new benchmark for video dataset distillation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we propose a novel pruning strategy, $\textbf{R}$eplace $\textbf{A}$ttention with $\textbf{M}$LP (RAM), that approximates the attention mechanism using only feedforward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projections, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance, so that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. RAM achieves a $62.579\%$ reduction in FLOPs for spatio-temporal models with less than $2.5\%$ performance drop, and a $42.233\%$ FLOPs reduction for LTSF models with less than $2\%$ performance drop.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges emerge when using promising images or environmental context masks to extract various factors for time-series network modeling, causing pre-processing errors or a loss of efficiency. Typically, pedestrian positions captured by onboard cameras are often distorted and do not accurately reflect their actual movements. To address these issues, GTransPDM -- a Graph-embedded Transformer with a Position Decoupling Module -- was developed for pedestrian crossing intention prediction by leveraging multi-modal features. First, a positional decoupling module was proposed to decompose pedestrian lateral motion and encode depth cues in the image view. Then, a graph-embedded Transformer was designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of human pose skeletons, integrating essential factors such as position, skeleton, and ego-vehicle motion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 92% accuracy on the PIE dataset and 87% accuracy on the JAAD dataset, with a processing speed of 0.05ms. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in comparison.</p></details> | IEEE SPL |
| **[Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04059v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks. Codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Data Completeness in Time Series: Imputation Strategies for Missing Data Using Significant Periodically Correlated Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02008v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data is a pervasive issue in statistical analyses, affecting the reliability and validity of research across diverse scientific disciplines. Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[How Deep is your Guess? A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSI-Bench: Benchmarking Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12747v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

Despite their strengths, they struggle with capturing high-dimensional distributions and cross-feature dependencies. Recent work explores generative approaches using diffusion or flow-based models, extending to time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability remains a challenge. This work proposes a novel method combining recurrent neural networks' efficiency with diffusion models' probabilistic modeling, based on stochastic interpolants and conditional generation with control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |

Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data.

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

| **[MADS: Modulated Auto-Decoding SIREN for time series imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00868v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation remains a significant challenge across many fields due to the potentially significant variability in the type of data being modelled. Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Networked Time Series Imputation via Position-aware Graph Enhanced Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18612v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |
| **[A General Framework for Uncertainty Quantification via Neural SDE-RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01189v1)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical yet unsolved challenge for deep learning, especially for the time series imputation with irregularly sampled measurements. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework based on the principles of recurrent neural networks and neural stochastic differential equations for reconciling irregularly sampled measurements. We impute measurements at any arbitrary timescale and quantify the uncertainty in the imputations in a principled manner. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantifying and propagating the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across time instants. Our experiments on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution system reveal that our framework can outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification approaches for time-series data imputations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we focus on time series data and put forward SSSD, an imputation model that relies on two emerging technologies, (conditional) diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative models and structured state space models as internal model architecture, which are particularly suited to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. We demonstrate that SSSD matches or even exceeds state-of-the-art probabilistic imputation and forecasting performance on a broad range of data sets and different missingness scenarios, including the challenging blackout-missing scenarios, where prior approaches failed to provide meaningful results.</p></details> | <details><summary>V3: U...</summary><p>V3: Updated results for the solar dataset. 36 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Time-Series Imputation with Wasserstein Interpolation for Optimal Look-Ahead-Bias and Variance Tradeoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12736v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing time-series data is a prevalent practical problem. Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |
| **[Filling out the missing gaps: Time Series Imputation with Semi-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04275v1)** | 2023-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data in time series is a challenging issue affecting time series analysis. Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDIS: Random Drop Imputation with Self-Training for Incomplete Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10075v2)** | 2023-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data with missing values are commonly encountered in many fields, such as healthcare, meteorology, and robotics. The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |
| **[STING: Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10801v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[Filling the G_ap_s: Multivariate Time Series Imputation by Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00298v3)** | 2022-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dealing with missing values and incomplete time series is a labor-intensive, tedious, inevitable task when handling data coming from real-world applications. Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502v2)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines.

| **[Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |
| **[CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09904v2)** | 2019-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications involve multivariate, geo-tagged time series data: at each location, multiple sensors record corresponding measurements. For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations.

| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19341v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |

Existing works typically assume regularly sampled, well-structured data, limiting their applicability to more generalized scenarios where time series often contain missing values, unequal sequence lengths, and irregular time intervals between measurements. To cover diverse domains and handle variable regularities, we propose FlexTSF, a universal time series forecasting model that possesses better generalization and natively support both regular and irregular time series. FlexTSF produces forecasts in an autoregressive manner and incorporates three novel designs: VT-Norm, a normalization strategy to ablate data domain barriers, IVP Patcher, a patching module to learn representations from flexibly structured time series, and LED attention, an attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these two and propagate forecasts with awareness of domain and time information. Experiments on 12 datasets show that FlexTSF outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models respectively designed for regular and irregular time series. Furthermore, after self-supervised pre-training, FlexTSF shows exceptional performance in both zero-shot and few-show settings for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |

This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy.

| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |

However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Aggregation with Dynamic Local Attention for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07744v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series data is characterized by varying time intervals between consecutive observations of measured variables/signals (i.e., features) and varying sampling rates (i.e., recordings/measurement) across these features. Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |
| **[Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Preprocessing Time Series Data for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14720v2)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data preprocessing is a crucial part of any machine learning pipeline, and it can have a significant impact on both performance and training efficiency. This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

| **[Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting asynchronous bioprocess timeseries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02079v2)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cultivation experiments often produce sparse and irregular time series. Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Deep Efficient Continuous Manifold Learning for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03379v2)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling non-Euclidean data is drawing extensive attention along with the unprecedented successes of deep neural networks in diverse fields. Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUTS+: High-dimensional Causal Discovery from Irregular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05890v2)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series is a fundamental problem in the machine learning community, enabling causal reasoning and decision-making in complex scenarios. Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |
| **[Time-Parameterized Convolutional Neural Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03210v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

| **[Warpformer: A Multi-scale Modeling Approach for Irregular Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09368v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in various fields, particularly in healthcare, and exhibit two key characteristics: intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |

However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it.

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity.

Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |

Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop&Hop: Early Classification of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09795v1)** | 2022-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early classification algorithms help users react faster to their machine learning model's predictions. Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

| **[Modeling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11344v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modeling sequential data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |
| **[Improved Batching Strategy For Irregular Time-Series ODE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05708v1)** | 2022-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series data are prevalent in the real world and are challenging to model with a simple recurrent neural network (RNN). Hence, a model that combines the use of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and RNN was proposed (ODE-RNN) to model irregular time series with higher accuracy, but it suffers from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Convolutions: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Raw Seismic Data Ingestion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13631v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional seismic processing workflows (SPW) are expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Integration Learning for Irregularly-sampled Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09986v2)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) data is sparse and irregular as it is recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926v2)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Model for Demand and Supply Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12469v1)** | 2020-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for demand forecasting only focus on modeling the temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage, causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025.

| **[When Are Concepts Erased From Diffusion Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17013v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nyu-dice-lab.github.io/when-are-concepts-erased/</p></details> |
| **[Bringing Objects to Life: training-free 4D generation from 3D objects through view consistent noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20422v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have enabled the creation of dynamic 4D content - 3D objects in motion - based on text prompts, which holds potential for applications in virtual worlds, media, and gaming. Existing methods provide control over the appearance of generated content, including the ability to animate 3D objects. However, their ability to generate dynamics is limited to the mesh datasets they were trained on, lacking any growth or structural development capability. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for animating 3D objects by conditioning on textual prompts to guide 4D generation, enabling custom general scenes while maintaining the original object's identity. We first convert a 3D mesh into a static 4D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that preserves the object's visual attributes. Then, we animate the object using an Image-to-Video diffusion model driven by text. To improve motion realism, we introduce a view-consistent noising protocol that aligns object perspectives with the noising process to promote lifelike movement, and a masked Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss that leverages attention maps to focus optimization on relevant regions, better preserving the original object. We evaluate our model on two different 3D object datasets for temporal coherence, prompt adherence, and visual fidelity, and find that our method outperforms the baseline based on multiview training, achieving better consistency with the textual prompt in hard scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference via Efficient KV Caching and Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21467v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoDA: Coordinated Diffusion Noise Optimization for Whole-Body Manipulation of Articulated Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21437v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization. Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS), where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise, producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from hand-only data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://phj128.github.io/page/CoDA/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Convergence Theory for Diffusion Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21400v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09342v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2025.

| **[Regularized Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Distributional Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19519v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Residual Shifting Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution via Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13358v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagicTryOn: Harnessing Diffusion Transformer for Garment-Preserving Video Virtual Try-on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21325v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer.We replace the U-Net architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recent Advances in Diffusion Models for Hyperspectral Image Processing and Analysis: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11158v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Parallel Tempering via Neural Transports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10328v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are essential tools in computational statistics for sampling from unnormalised probability distributions, but can be fragile when targeting high-dimensional, multimodal, or complex target distributions. Parallel Tempering (PT) enhances MCMC's sample efficiency through annealing and parallel computation, propagating samples from tractable reference distributions to intractable targets via state swapping across interpolating distributions. The effectiveness of PT is limited by the often minimal overlap between adjacent distributions in challenging problems, which requires increasing the computational resources to compensate. We introduce a framework that accelerates PT by leveraging neural samplers-including normalising flows, diffusion models, and controlled diffusions-to reduce the required overlap. Our approach utilises neural samplers in parallel, circumventing the computational burden of neural samplers while preserving the asymptotic consistency of classical PT. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically on a variety of multimodal sampling problems that our method improves sample quality, reduces the computational cost compared to classical PT, and enables efficient free energies/normalising constants estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sci-Fi: Symmetric Constraint for Frame Inbetweening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21205v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs) by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance, naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames. To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint, enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared with other baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, submitted to NeurIPS2025, under reviewering</p></details> |

While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown} link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.</p></details> | accpeted on ICML25 |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models with Classifier-Free Gibbs-like Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21101v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving conditional diffusion models by linearly combining the outputs of conditional and unconditional denoisers. While CFG enhances visual quality and improves alignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a challenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we make two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a well-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common intuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated with the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the data distribution is tilted by a power $w \gt 1$ of the conditional distribution. We identify the missing component: a R\'enyi divergence term that acts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it consistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term vanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted distribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional diffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity while progressively enhancing sample quality. We evaluate our approach on both image and text-to-audio generation tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over CFG across all considered metrics.

To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce {\bf RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed {\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores (-0.2\%).</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploring Out-of-distribution Detection for Sparse-view Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06308v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and ``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Unbiased Sampling from Boltzmann Distributions via Variance-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21005v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling. On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facial Attribute Based Text Guided Face Anonymization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21002v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of computer vision applications necessitates handling vast amounts of visual data, often containing personal information. While this technology offers significant benefits, it should not compromise privacy. Data privacy regulations emphasize the need for individual consent for processing personal data, hindering researchers' ability to collect high-quality datasets containing the faces of the individuals. This paper presents a deep learning-based face anonymization pipeline to overcome this challenge. Unlike most of the existing methods, our method leverages recent advancements in diffusion-based inpainting models, eliminating the need for training Generative Adversarial Networks. The pipeline employs a three-stage approach: face detection with RetinaNet, feature extraction with VGG-Face, and realistic face generation using the state-of-the-art BrushNet diffusion model. BrushNet utilizes the entire image, face masks, and text prompts specifying desired facial attributes like age, ethnicity, gender, and expression. This enables the generation of natural-looking images with unrecognizable individuals, facilitating the creation of privacy-compliant datasets for computer vision research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, published in the Proceedings of the Joint visuAAL-GoodBrother Conference on Trustworthy Video- and Audio-Based Assistive Technologies</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and no-reference quality assessments.</p></details> |  |

Current text-to-image (T2I) generation diffusion models, though proficient at producing high-quality images, often struggle to incorporate text accurately onto complex surfaces with varied perspectives, such as angled views of architectural elements like buildings, banners, or walls. In this paper, we introduce the Surface Oriented Textual Image Generation (OrienText) method, which leverages region-specific surface normals as conditional input to T2I generation diffusion model. Our approach ensures accurate rendering and correct orientation of the text within the image context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the OrienText method on a self-curated dataset of images and compare it against the existing textual image generation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Technical Communications</p></details> |

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes, using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hala-djeghim.github.io/SAIL/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08005v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in training one-step diffusion models typically follow a two-stage pipeline: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This process often depends on both the teacher's score function for supervision and its weights for initializing the student model. In this paper, we explore whether one-step diffusion models can be trained directly without this distillation procedure. We introduce a family of new training methods that entirely forgo teacher score supervision, yet outperforms most teacher-guided distillation approaches. This suggests that score supervision is not essential for effective training of one-step diffusion models. However, we find that initializing the student model with the teacher's weights remains critical. Surprisingly, the key advantage of teacher initialization is not due to better latent-to-output mappings, but rather the rich set of feature representations across different noise levels that the teacher diffusion model provides. These insights take us one step closer towards training one-step diffusion models without distillation and provide a better understanding of the roles of teacher supervision and initialization in the distillation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical image translation, Diffusion model, 16 pages</p></details> |

Unlike previous training-free approaches that rely solely on semantic-level guidance without addressing instance individuation, our training-free method, Instance-to-Semantic Attention Control (ISAC), explicitly resolves incomplete instance formation and semantic entanglement through an instance-first modeling approach. This enables ISAC to effectively leverage a hierarchical, tree-structured prompt mechanism, disentangling multiple object instances and individually aligning them with their corresponding semantic labels. Without employing any external models, ISAC achieves up to 52% average multi-class accuracy and 83% average multi-instance accuracy by effectively forming disentangled instances.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter. Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/omnipainter_project</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Agent World Modeling from a Diffusion-Inspired Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20922v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches derive semantic embeddings and integrate them into advanced diffusion models to enable geometry-editable generation. However, these highly compact embeddings encode only high-level semantic cues and inevitably discard fine-grained appearance details. We introduce a Disentangled Geometry-editable and Appearance-preserving Diffusion (DGAD) model that first leverages semantic embeddings to implicitly capture the desired geometric transformations and then employs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism to align fine-grained appearance features with the geometry-edited representation, facilitating both precise geometry editing and faithful appearance preservation in object composition. Specifically, DGAD builds on CLIP/DINO-derived and reference networks to extract semantic embeddings and appearance-preserving representations, which are then seamlessly integrated into the encoding and decoding pipelines in a disentangled manner. We first integrate the semantic embeddings into pre-trained diffusion models that exhibit strong spatial reasoning capabilities to implicitly capture object geometry, thereby facilitating flexible object manipulation and ensuring effective editability. Then, we design a dense cross-attention mechanism that leverages the implicitly learned object geometry to retrieve and spatially align appearance features with their corresponding regions, ensuring faithful appearance consistency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGAD framework.</p></details> |  |

However, their full potential in solving Continuous Constrained Optimization problems remains largely underexplored. Our work commences by investigating a two-dimensional constrained quadratic optimization problem as an illustrative example to explore the inherent challenges and issues when applying diffusion models to such optimization tasks and providing theoretical analyses for these observations. To address the identified gaps and harness diffusion models for Continuous Constrained Optimization, we build upon this analysis to propose a novel diffusion-based framework for optimization problems called DiOpt. This framework operates in two distinct phases: an initial warm-start phase, implemented via supervised learning, followed by a bootstrapping phase. This dual-phase architecture is designed to iteratively refine solutions, thereby improving the objective function while rigorously satisfying problem constraints. Finally, multiple candidate solutions are sampled, and the optimal one is selected through a screening process. We present extensive experiments detailing the training dynamics of DiOpt, its performance across a diverse set of Continuous Constrained Optimization problems, and an analysis of the impact of DiOpt's various hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, inconsistencies in topological structure, geometrical parameters as well as joint correspondence make it difficult to handle diverse embodiments with a unified retargeting architecture. In this work, we propose a novel unified graph-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation framework for retargeting reference motions across diverse embodiments. The intrinsic characteristics of heterogeneous embodiments are represented with graph structure that effectively captures topological and geometrical features of different robots. Such a graph-based encoding further allows for knowledge exploitation at the joint level with a customized attention mechanisms developed in this work. For lacking ground truth motions of the desired embodiment, we utilize an energy-based guidance formulated as retargeting losses to train the diffusion model. As one of the first cross-embodiment motion retargeting methods in robotics, our experiments validate that the proposed model can retarget motions across heterogeneous embodiments in a unified manner. Moreover, it demonstrates a certain degree of generalization to both diverse skeletal structures and similar motion patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems. First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level, providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part (frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks ("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model. The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex, changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community. Project page: https://zgctroy.github.io/frame-level-captions .</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose SC-Pro (Spherical or Circular Probing), a training-free framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (SC-Pro-o), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.</p></details> |  |

Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior, which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces \textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches are constrained by the limited word embeddings provided in pre-training, which hinders nuanced editing targeting open concepts with specific attributes. Directly altering the keywords in target prompts often results in unintended disruptions to the attention mechanisms. To achieve more flexible editing easily, this work proposes an improved concept-augmented video editing approach that generates diverse and stable target videos flexibly by devising abstract conceptual pairs. Specifically, the framework involves concept-augmented textual inversion and a dual prior supervision mechanism. The former enables plug-and-play guidance of stable diffusion for video editing, effectively capturing target attributes for more stylized results. The dual prior supervision mechanism significantly enhances video stability and fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates more stable and lifelike videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |

Offline MORL provides a promising solution by training on pre-collected datasets to generalize to any preference upon deployment. However, real-world offline datasets are often conservatively and narrowly distributed, failing to comprehensively cover preferences, leading to the emergence of out-of-distribution (OOD) preference areas. Existing offline MORL algorithms exhibit poor generalization to OOD preferences, resulting in policies that do not align with preferences. Leveraging the excellent expressive and generalization capabilities of diffusion models, we propose MODULI (Multi-objective Diffusion Planner with Sliding Guidance), which employs a preference-conditioned diffusion model as a planner to generate trajectories that align with various preferences and derive action for decision-making. To achieve accurate generation, MODULI introduces two return normalization methods under diverse preferences for refining guidance. To further enhance generalization to OOD preferences, MODULI proposes a novel sliding guidance mechanism, which involves training an additional slider adapter to capture the direction of preference changes. Incorporating the slider, it transitions from in-distribution (ID) preferences to generating OOD preferences, patching, and extending the incomplete Pareto front. Extensive experiments on the D4MORL benchmark demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art Offline MORL baselines, exhibiting excellent generalization to OOD preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML2025, code link: https://github.com/pickxiguapi/MODULI</p></details> |
| **[Restoring Real-World Images with an Internal Detail Enhancement Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18674v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex, mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise. Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges: achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique, which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[BCDDM: Branch-Corrected Denoising Diffusion Model for Black Hole Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08528v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), a deep learning framework that synthesizes black hole images directly from physical parameters. The model incorporates a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to enhance accuracy and stability. We have constructed a dataset of 2,157 GRRT-simulated images for training the BCDDM, which spans seven key physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. BCDDM offers a novel approach to reducing the computational costs of black hole image generation, providing a faster and more efficient pathway for dataset augmentation, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10figures |

Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by detailed ablation study and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In production environments, image editing typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image template to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the editing process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper, we present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests. The key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked regions of image templates while preserving the original content in the unmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant computations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate activations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading overhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps computation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in online serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel continuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly arrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising computation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous masks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing strategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache loading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving systems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing average request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Causal Composition Diffusion Model for Closed-loop Traffic Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17920v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is critical for safety evaluation in autonomous driving, particularly in capturing complex interactive behaviors. However, generating realistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a significant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting objective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which is amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal Compositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework to address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable and realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem. Then, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by automatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the diffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and controllability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a closed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred trajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and leveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on key metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

Compared to the single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information, which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts. Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex articulated objects. Our code and dataset will be released to the community upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[ART-DECO: Arbitrary Text Guidance for 3D Detailizer Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20431v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting" within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring dedicated training or additional data collection.</p></details> |  |

However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

When applied to solving inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly), our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to SOTA baselines, our experiments across several linear and non-linear tasks (with natural and medical images) demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard similarity metrics and run-time.</p></details> |  |

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed as seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling.

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, they struggle to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for interactive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ryanpo.com/ssm_wm</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules, resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization. Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset, comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions. Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements -- reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Generalization in Diffusion Models via Probability Flow Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20123v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on generalization in diffusion models.</p></details> | 41 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Refining Few-Step Text-to-Multiview Diffusion via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20107v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC), which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance (PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

| **[Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20053v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model's training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis. Extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of RectifiedHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhenyangcs.github.io/RectifiedHR-Diffusion/</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on geometric or semantic feature embedding to establish correspondences and estimate transformations or flow fields. Recently, state-of-the-art methods have employed RAFT-like iterative updates to refine the solution. However, these methods have certain limitations. Firstly, their iterative refinement design lacks transparency, and their iterative updates follow a fixed path during the refinement process, which can lead to suboptimal results. Secondly, these methods overlook the importance of refining or optimizing correspondences (or matching matrices) as a precursor to solving transformations or flow fields. They typically compute candidate correspondences based on distances in the point feature space. However, they only project the candidate matching matrix into some matrix space once with Sinkhorn or dual softmax operations to obtain final correspondences. This one-shot projected matching matrix may be far from the globally optimal one, and these approaches do not consider the distribution of the target matching matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the Denoising Diffusion Model to predict a searching gradient for the optimal matching matrix within the Doubly Stochastic Matrix Space. During the reverse denoising process, our method iteratively searches for better solutions along this denoising gradient, which points towards the maximum likelihood direction of the target matching matrix. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the search to start from any initial matching matrix provided by the online backbone or white noise. Experimental evaluations on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and 4DMatch/4DLoMatch datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly designed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentive Eraser: Unleashing Diffusion Model's Object Removal Potential via Self-Attention Redirection Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12974v6)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability. Code is available at https://github.com/Anonym0u3/AttentiveEraser.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[ICDM: Interference Cancellation Diffusion Models for Wireless Semantic Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19983v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise, but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems. In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference, along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE journal</p></details> |

However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05908v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a backward diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.</p></details> |  |

Previous attacks largely depend on the availability of the diffusion model or involve a lengthy optimization process. In this work, we investigate a more practical and universal attack that does not require the presence of a target model and demonstrate that the high-dimensional text embedding space inherently contains NSFW concepts that can be exploited to generate harmful images. We present the Jailbreaking Prompt Attack (JPA). JPA first searches for the target malicious concepts in the text embedding space using a group of antonyms generated by ChatGPT. Subsequently, a prefix prompt is optimized in the discrete vocabulary space to align malicious concepts semantically in the text embedding space. We further introduce a soft assignment with gradient masking technique that allows us to perform gradient ascent in the discrete vocabulary space. We perform extensive experiments with open-sourced T2I models, e.g. stable-diffusion-v1-4 and closed-sourced online services, e.g. DALLE2, Midjourney with black-box safety checkers. Results show that (1) JPA bypasses both text and image safety checkers (2) while preserving high semantic alignment with the target prompt. (3) JPA demonstrates a much faster speed than previous methods and can be executed in a fully automated manner. These merits render it a valuable tool for robustness evaluation in future text-to-image generation research.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Image is Worth a Thousand Words: A Usability Preservable Text-Image Collaborative Erasing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11131v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

Despite its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for future studies.</p></details> |  |

Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge (DSB) framework to cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases). Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.</p></details> |  |

Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in reward engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This paper introduces TeViR, a novel method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with current observations. Experimental results across 11 complex robotic tasks demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR's ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its potential to advance reinforcement learning applications in robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

We propose two energies: both of them are based on the same classical weighted $H^1$-semi norm to model the local part, while two different weighted $H^s$-semi norms, with $s \in (0,1)$, are used to model the nonlocal part. The corresponding strong formulations are derived. In doing so, one needs to develop some technical tools, such as suitable integration by parts formulas for operators with variable diffusivity, and one also needs to study the mapping properties of the Neumann operators that arise. In contrast to problems coupling purely local models, in which one requires transmission conditions on the interface between the subdomains, the presence of a nonlocal operator may give rise to nonlocal fluxes. These nonlocal fluxes may enter the problem as a source term, thereby changing its structure. Finally, we focus on a specific problem, that we consider most relevant, and study regularity of solutions and finite element discretizations. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the most salient features of the models.</p></details> |  |

However, agile locomotion in highly constrained environments such as stepping stones is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a combination of model-based control, search, and learning to design efficient control policies for agile locomotion on stepping stones. In our framework, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, we propose to use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). While the combination of MCTS and NMPC can quickly find a feasible plan for a given environment (a few seconds), it is not yet suitable to be used as a reactive policy. Hence, we generate a dataset for optimal goal-conditioned policy for a given scene and learn it through supervised learning. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models in handling multi-modality in the dataset. We test our proposed framework on a scenario where our quadruped robot Solo12 successfully jumps to different goals in a highly constrained environment.</p></details> |  |

This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the extremum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment.

However, existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers, limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER) task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g., stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically, KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception. Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment (CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA VER model TGCA-PVT.

In particular, guiding diffusion models on graphs under arbitrary reward signals is difficult: gradient-based methods, while powerful, are often unsuitable due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs, and non-differentiable rewards further complicate gradient-based guidance. We propose Graph Guided Diffusion (GGDiff), a novel guidance framework that interprets conditional diffusion on graphs as a stochastic control problem to address this challenge. GGDiff unifies multiple guidance strategies, including gradient-based guidance (for differentiable rewards), control-based guidance (using control signals from forward reward evaluations), and zero-order approximations (bridging gradient-based and gradient-free optimization). This comprehensive, plug-and-play framework enables zero-shot guidance of pre-trained diffusion models under both differentiable and non-differentiable reward functions, adapting well-established guidance techniques to graph generation--a direction largely unexplored. Our formulation balances computational efficiency, reward alignment, and sample quality, enabling practical conditional generation across diverse reward types. We demonstrate the efficacy of GGDiff in various tasks, including constraints on graph motifs, fairness, and link prediction, achieving superior alignment with target rewards while maintaining diversity and fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSAT: Graph Structure Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21288v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing data represented in graph structures, achieving remarkable success across a wide range of applications. However, to further improve the performance on graph classification benchmarks, structural representation of each node that encodes rich local topological information in the neighbourhood of nodes is an important type of feature that is often overlooked in the modeling. The consequence of neglecting the structural information has resulted high number of layers to connect messages from distant nodes which by itself produces other problems such as oversmoothing. In the present paper, we leverage these structural information that are modeled by anonymous random walks (ARWs) and introduce graph structure attention network (GSAT) which is a generalization of graph attention network(GAT) to integrate the original attribute and the structural representation to enforce the model to automatically find patterns for attending to different edges in the node neighbourhood to enrich graph representation. Our experiments show GSAT slightly improves SOTA on some graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[HeteroBA: A Structure-Manipulating Backdoor Attack on Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21140v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently drawn increasing attention for modeling complex multi-relational data in domains such as recommendation, finance, and social networks. While existing research has been largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReassembleNet: Learnable Keypoints and Diffusion for 2D Fresco Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21117v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains, including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance.To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and effective.Extensive tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Directed Semi-Simplicial Learning with Applications to Brain Activity Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17939v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from pairwise interactions but often overlook multi-way and hierarchical relationships. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks, outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We will make the code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S and extreme event simulation.

| **[Efficient Identity and Position Graph Embedding via Spectral-Based Random Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20992v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture graph structures via a feature aggregation mechanism following the graph embedding framework, have demonstrated a powerful ability to support various tasks. According to the topology properties (e.g., structural roles or community memberships of nodes) to be preserved, graph embedding can be categorized into identity and position embedding. However, it is unclear for most GNN-based methods which property they can capture. Some of them may also suffer from low efficiency and scalability caused by several time- and space-consuming procedures (e.g., feature extraction and training). From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that high- and low-frequency information in the graph spectral domain may characterize node identities and positions, respectively. Based on this investigation, we propose random feature aggregation (RFA) for efficient identity and position embedding, serving as an extreme ablation study regarding GNN feature aggregation. RFA (i) adopts a spectral-based GNN without learnable parameters as its backbone, (ii) only uses random noises as inputs, and (iii) derives embeddings via just one feed-forward propagation (FFP). Inspired by degree-corrected spectral clustering, we further introduce a degree correction mechanism to the GNN backbone. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can respectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one FFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better trade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position embedding over various baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20980v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCheck: Breaking Long-Term Text Barriers with Extracted Knowledge Graph-Powered Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16514v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |

This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple yet Effective Graph Distillation via Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20807v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite plentiful successes achieved by graph representation learning in various domains, the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) still remains tenaciously challenging due to the tremendous computational overhead needed for sizable graphs in practice. Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD. Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the paper "Simple yet Effective Graph Distillation via Clustering" accepted by KDD 2025</p></details> |

To improve retrieval accuracy, the Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment (COLIEE) is held annually, offering updated benchmark datasets for evaluation. This paper presents a detailed description of CaseLink, the method employed by UQLegalAI, the second highest team in Task 1 of COLIEE 2025. The CaseLink model utilises inductive graph learning and Global Case Graphs to capture the intrinsic case connectivity to improve the accuracy of legal case retrieval. Specifically, a large language model specialized in text embedding is employed to transform legal texts into embeddings, which serve as the feature representations of the nodes in the constructed case graph. A new contrastive objective, incorporating a regularization on the degree of case nodes, is proposed to leverage the information within the case reference relationship for model optimization. The main codebase used in our method is based on an open-sourced repo of CaseLink: https://github.com/yanran-tang/CaseLink.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Graph Lingual Network (GLN), a GNN built on large language models (LLMs), with hidden representations in the form of human-readable text. Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques, including graph attention and initial residual connection. The comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node classification and link prediction, outperforming existing LLM-based baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and datasets are in https://github.com/kswoo97/GLN-Code</p></details> |

However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22\% reduction in mean absolute error over strong baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science.

Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects, enhancing expressivity and interpretability. Learning to predict the stereoelectronics-infused representation with a tailored double graph neural network workflow enables its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task without expensive quantum chemical calculations. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic information significantly improves the performance of message-passing 2D machine learning models for molecular property prediction. We show that the learned representations trained on small molecules can accurately extrapolate to much larger molecular structures, yielding chemical insight into orbital interactions for previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design. Finally, we have developed a web application (simg.cheme.cmu.edu) where users can rapidly explore stereoelectronic information for their own molecular systems.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Standard message-passing neural networks, which often aggregate local neighbors via mean-aggregation, can be regarded as convolving with a simple rectangular waveform which is non-zero only on 1-hop neighbors of every vertex. Here, we go beyond such local averaging. We will convolve the node features with more sophisticated waveforms generated using dynamics such as the heat equation, wave equation, and the Sprott model (an example of chaotic dynamics). Furthermore, we use snapshots of these dynamics at different time points to create waveforms at many effective scales. Theoretically, we show that these dynamic waveforms can capture salient information about the graph including connected components, connectivity, and cycle structures even with no features. Empirically, we test DYMAG on both real and synthetic benchmarks to establish that DYMAG outperforms baseline models on recovery of graph persistence, generating parameters of random graphs, as well as property prediction for proteins, molecules and materials. Our code is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/DYMAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Training of Graph Neural Networks: A Multiscale Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19666v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, finding applications across diverse domains. However, as graph sizes and connectivity increase, standard GNN training methods face significant computational and memory challenges, limiting their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel framework for efficient multiscale training of GNNs. Our approach leverages hierarchical graph representations and subgraphs, enabling the integration of information across multiple scales and resolutions. By utilizing coarser graph abstractions and subgraphs, each with fewer nodes and edges, we significantly reduce computational overhead during training. Building on this framework, we propose a suite of scalable training strategies, including coarse-to-fine learning, subgraph-to-full-graph transfer, and multiscale gradient computation. We also provide some theoretical analysis of our methods and demonstrate their effectiveness across various datasets and learning tasks. Our results show that multiscale training can substantially accelerate GNN training for large scale problems while maintaining, or even improving, predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing studies focus primarily on single-graph reasoning, leaving the critical challenge of multi-graph joint reasoning underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the multi-graph reasoning abilities of VLMs. Our benchmark covers four common graph types-knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps-and supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph groupings with tasks of increasing complexity. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs under a multi-dimensional scoring framework that assesses graph parsing, reasoning consistency, and instruction-following accuracy. Additionally, we fine-tune multiple open-source models and observe consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our dataset. This work provides a principled step toward advancing multi-graph understanding and reveals new opportunities for cross-modal graph intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference-Based Gradient Estimation for ML-Guided Approximate Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19377v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems arise across a broad spectrum of domains, including medicine, logistics, and manufacturing. While exact solutions are often computationally infeasible, many practical applications require high-quality solutions within a given time budget. To address this, we propose a learning-based approach that enhances existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. Specifically, we parameterize these approximation algorithms and train graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict parameter values that yield near-optimal solutions. Our method is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion, using a novel gradient estimation scheme that treats the approximation algorithm as a black box. This approach combines the strengths of learning and traditional algorithms: the GNN learns from data to guide the algorithm toward better solutions, while the approximation algorithm ensures feasibility. We validate our method on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and the minimum k-cut problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |
| **[An Out-Of-Distribution Membership Inference Attack Approach for Cross-Domain Graph Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20074v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Network-based methods face privacy leakage risks due to the introduction of topological structures about the targets, which allows attackers to bypass the target's prior knowledge of the sensitive attributes and realize membership inference attacks (MIA) by observing and analyzing the topology distribution. As privacy concerns grow, the assumption of MIA, which presumes that attackers can obtain an auxiliary dataset with the same distribution, is increasingly deviating from reality. In this paper, we categorize the distribution diversity issue in real-world MIA scenarios as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, and propose a novel Graph OOD Membership Inference Attack (GOOD-MIA) to achieve cross-domain graph attacks. Specifically, we construct shadow subgraphs with distributions from different domains to model the diversity of real-world data. We then explore the stable node representations that remain unchanged under external influences and consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and extracting task-relevant key information to more clearly distinguish between the characteristics of training data and unseen data. This OOD-based design makes cross-domain graph attacks possible. Finally, we perform risk extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack inference to generalize the attack to other domains. Experimental results demonstrate that GOOD-MIA achieves superior attack performance in datasets designed for multiple domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Wave Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20034v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing (MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing. Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs, facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time, which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable, enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, published to WWW 2025</p></details> |

Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model-Enhanced Message Passing for Heterophilic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19762v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which rely on homophily-driven message passing, struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes exhibit dissimilar features and different labels. While existing methods address heterophily through graph structure refinement or adaptation of neighbor aggregation functions, they often overlook the semantic potential of node text, rely on suboptimal message representation for propagation and compromise performance on homophilic graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel language model (LM)-enhanced message passing approach for heterophilic graph leaning (LEMP4HG). Specifically, in the context of text-attributed graph, we provide paired node texts for LM to generate their connection analysis, which are encoded and then fused with paired node textual embeddings through a gating mechanism. The synthesized messages are semantically enriched and adaptively balanced with both nodes' information, which mitigates contradictory signals when neighbor aggregation in heterophilic regions. Furthermore, we introduce an active learning strategy guided by our heuristic MVRD (Modulated Variation of Reliable Distance), selectively enhancing node pairs suffer most from message passing, reducing the cost of analysis generation and side effects on homophilic regions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach excels on heterophilic graphs and performs robustly on homophilic ones, with a graph convolutional network (GCN) backbone and a practical budget.</p></details> |  |

However, how exactly these methods help alleviate the oversmoothing problem from a theoretical perspective is not well understood. In this work, we provide a formal and precise characterization of (linearized) GNNs with residual connections and normalization layers. We establish that (a) for residual connections, the incorporation of the initial features at each layer can prevent the signal from becoming too smooth, and determines the subspace of possible node representations; (b) batch normalization prevents a complete collapse of the output embedding space to a one-dimensional subspace through the individual rescaling of each column of the feature matrix. This results in the convergence of node representations to the top-$k$ eigenspace of the message-passing operator; (c) moreover, we show that the centering step of a normalization layer -- which can be understood as a projection -- alters the graph signal in message-passing in such a way that relevant information can become harder to extract. We therefore introduce a novel, principled normalization layer called GraphNormv2 in which the centering step is learned such that it does not distort the original graph signal in an undesirable way. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While inherently interpretable GNN architectures like Graph Multi-linear Networks (GMT) have emerged, they remain vulnerable to generating explanations based on spurious correlations, potentially undermining trust in critical applications. We present MetaGMT, a meta-learning framework that enhances explanation fidelity through a novel bi-level optimization approach. We demonstrate that MetaGMT significantly improves both explanation quality (AUC-ROC, Precision@K) and robustness to spurious patterns, across BA-2Motifs, MUTAG, and SP-Motif benchmarks. Our approach maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing more faithful explanations (with an increase up to 8% of Explanation ROC on SP-Motif 0.5) compared to baseline methods. These advancements in interpretability could enable safer deployment of GNNs in sensitive domains by (1) facilitating model debugging through more reliable explanations, (2) supporting targeted retraining when biases are identified, and (3) enabling meaningful human oversight. By addressing the critical challenge of explanation reliability, our work contributes to building more trustworthy and actionable GNN systems for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages Main Content, 10 Pages including Appendix. 1 Figure, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FedHERO: A Federated Learning Approach for Node Classification Task on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21206v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are either computationally expensive or lacking in provable expressiveness. In this paper, we observe that the chords increase the complexity of the graph structure while contributing little useful information in many cases. In contrast, chordless structures are more efficient and effective for representing the graph. Therefore, when leveraging the information of cycles, we choose to omit the chords. Accordingly, we propose a Chordless Structure-based Graph Neural Network (CSGNN) and prove that its expressiveness is strictly more powerful than the k-hop GNN (KPGNN) with polynomial complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that CSGNN outperforms existing GNNs across various graph tasks while incurring lower computational costs and achieving better performance than the GNNs of 3-WL expressiveness.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization.

However, most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing, which aggregates local neighborhood information iteratively and struggles to explicitly capture such fundamental motifs, like triangles, k-cliques, and rings. This limitation hinders both expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a novel framework that bypasses message passing by learning directly from graph substructures. GPM efficiently extracts, encodes, and prioritizes task-relevant graph patterns, offering greater expressivity and improved ability to capture long-range dependencies. Empirical evaluations across four standard tasks -- node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression -- demonstrate that GPM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that GPM exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, desirable scalability, and enhanced interpretability.

While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

This vulnerability has spurred a growing focus on designing robust GNNs. Despite this interest, current advancements have predominantly relied on empirical trial and error, resulting in a limited understanding of the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we conduct the first large-scale systematic study on the adversarial robustness of GNNs by considering the patterns of input graphs, the architecture of GNNs, and their model capacity, along with discussions on sensitive neurons and adversarial transferability. This work proposes a comprehensive empirical framework for analyzing the adversarial robustness of GNNs. To support the analysis of adversarial robustness in GNNs, we introduce two evaluation metrics: the confidence-based decision surface and the accuracy-based adversarial transferability rate. Through experimental analysis, we derive 11 actionable guidelines for designing robust GNNs, enabling model developers to gain deeper insights. The code of this study is available at https://github.com/star4455/GraphRE.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Final Layer Holds the Key: A Unified and Efficient GNN Calibration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11335v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two non-trivial challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment; and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter, which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3) Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters.

Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable the prediction of unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen during training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining predictive performance. Beyond efficiency, K-Paths bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, enabling scalable and explainable LLM-augmented scientific discovery. We release our code and the retrieved paths as a benchmark for inductive reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The training of GNNs, especially on specialized tasks such as bioinformatics, demands extensive expert annotations, which are expensive and usually contain sensitive information of data providers. The trained GNN models are often shared for deployment in the real world. As neural networks can memorize the training samples, the model parameters of GNNs have a high risk of leaking private training data. Our theoretical analysis shows the strong connections between trained GNN parameters and the training graphs used, confirming the training graph leakage issue. However, explorations into training data leakage from trained GNNs are rather limited. Therefore, we investigate a novel problem of stealing graphs from trained GNNs. To obtain high-quality graphs that resemble the target training set, a graph diffusion model with diffusion noise optimization is deployed as a graph generator. Furthermore, we propose a selection method that effectively leverages GNN model parameters to identify training graphs from samples generated by the graph diffusion model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in stealing training graphs from the trained GNN.</p></details> | Accepted in KDD 2025 |

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD first introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs against inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from directly reconstructing the observed graph data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our G3AD can outperform twenty state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world graph anomaly datasets, with flexible generalization ability in different GNN backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TNNLS (14 pages, 10 figures)</p></details> |

To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters, enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors, and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly, learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data, where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically, bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class \texttt{NC}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03424v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fire safety is crucial for ensuring the stability of building structures, yet evaluating whether a structure meets fire safety requirement is challenging. Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Model Editing with Graph-Based External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18343v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18289v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become prominent methods for graph representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical results on diverse graph prediction tasks. In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |

GNNs enable differentiable end-to-end (E2E) learning of model parameters given graph structure which enables optimization towards popular node, edge (link) and graph-level tasks. While the research innovation in new GNN layers and training strategies has been rapid, industrial adoption and utility of GNNs has lagged considerably due to the unique scale challenges that large-scale graph ML problems create. In this work, we share our approach to training, inference, and utilization of GNNs at Snapchat. To this end, we present GiGL (Gigantic Graph Learning), an open-source library to enable large-scale distributed graph ML to the benefit of researchers, ML engineers, and practitioners. We use GiGL internally at Snapchat to manage the heavy lifting of GNN workflows, including graph data preprocessing from relational DBs, subgraph sampling, distributed training, inference, and orchestration. GiGL is designed to interface cleanly with open-source GNN modeling libraries prominent in academia like PyTorch Geometric (PyG), while handling scaling and productionization challenges that make it easier for internal practitioners to focus on modeling. GiGL is used in multiple production settings, and has powered over 35 launches across multiple business domains in the last 2 years in the contexts of friend recommendation, content recommendation and advertising. This work details high-level design and tools the library provides, scaling properties, case studies in diverse business settings with industry-scale graphs, and several key lessons learned in employing graph ML at scale on large social data.

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18088v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs. Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[NeuBM: Mitigating Model Bias in Graph Neural Networks through Neutral Input Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15180v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM (Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced feature representations throughout the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps (the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right) \mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional training or model modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision for Zero-Shot Inference on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17599v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, two major limitations severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b) impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility. To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 AI4Tech Track</p></details> |

Analyzing functional brain networks through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding mental disorder behaviors. Although existing fMRI-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in brain network feature extraction, they often fail to characterize complex relationships between brain regions and demographic information in mental disorders. To overcome these limitations, we propose a learnable NeuroTree framework that integrates a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and contrastive masked functional connectivity (CMFC) to enhance similarities and dissimilarities of brain region distance. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets. It provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns, elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models, face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for slide-level classification.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

A Comparative Study of VAE-GNN vs. ViT-MLP and VAE-MLP Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17363v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the exponential rise in IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various advanced techniques for both dimensionality reduction and attack detection to enhance IoT security. Among these, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), have garnered significant research attention in the domain of attack detection. This study evaluates the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for IoT botnet detection: a VAE encoder with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a VAE encoder with a GCN, a VAE encoder with a GAT, and a ViT encoder with an MLP. The evaluation is conducted on a widely studied IoT benchmark dataset--the N-BaIoT dataset for both binary and multiclass tasks. For the binary classification task, all models achieved over 99.93% in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with no notable differences in performance. In contrast, for the multiclass classification task, GNN-based models showed significantly lower performance compared to VAE-MLP and ViT-MLP, with accuracies of 86.42%, 89.46%, 99.72%, and 98.38% for VAE-GCN, VAE-GAT, VAE-MLP, and ViT-MLP, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A key advancement involves deploying attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs, leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection</p></details> |  |

Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.</p></details> |  |

A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data.

However, existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through pseudo-labeling.

Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods that have access to labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[Structure-Aligned Protein Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16896v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks, including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Statistical Test for Saliency Maps of Graph Neural Networks via Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16893v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.</p></details> |  |

These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backward Oversmoothing: why is it hard to train deep Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16736v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice, which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view. In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing. Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact. Our code can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/SPHNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairSIN: Achieving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks through Sensitive Information Neutralization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12474v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling graph-structured data, like other machine learning models, GNNs are also susceptible to making biased predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. For fairness consideration, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods propose to filter out sensitive information from inputs or representations, e.g., edge dropping or feature masking. However, we argue that such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature information, leading to a sub-optimal trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To address this issue, we unveil an innovative neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) are incorporated into node features or representations before message passing. The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional nonsensitive information. We also provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (neighbors with different sensitive attributes). We name our method as FairSIN, and present three implementation variants from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets with three different GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining high prediction accuracies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Joint Relational Database Generation via Graph-Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16527v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets. However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conf-GNNRec: Quantifying and Calibrating the Prediction Confidence for GNN-based Recommendation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16466v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically, we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction confidence and recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Aware Cyberterrorism Network Analysis using Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16371v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberterrorism poses a formidable threat to digital infrastructures, with increasing reliance on encrypted, decentralized platforms that obscure threat actor activity. To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\% classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025 February Cycle</p></details> |

The system is modeled as a graph structure. Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used. Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions, including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02454v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable confidence estimation is essential for enhancing the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes scenarios. Despite its importance, accurately estimating confidence in LLM responses remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose using an auxiliary learning model to assess response correctness based on the self-consistency of multiple outputs generated by the LLM. Our method builds a consistency graph to represent the agreement among multiple responses and uses a graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the likelihood that each response is correct. Experiments demonstrate that this method has strong calibration performance on various benchmark datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Algorithm Feedback: One-Shot SAT Solver Guidance with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16053v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science, yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17464v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphons are continuous models that represent the structure of graphs and allow the generation of graphs of varying sizes. We propose Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs. Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing TGNNs primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network, which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions. Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Conditional Flow Matching for Relational Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15668v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main content, submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |

Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2025 (KDD 2025). 14 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in embedding methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising improvements. However, these methods often lack a thorough analysis of their expressiveness and suffer from effective benchmarks for a fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to assess the expressiveness of existing methods, highlighting the impact of dual embeddings and decoder design on directed link prediction performance. To address limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a robust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and modular extensibility. The results on DirLinkBench show that current methods struggle to achieve strong performance, while DiGAE outperforms other baselines overall. We further revisit DiGAE theoretically, showing its graph convolution aligns with GCN on an undirected bipartite graph. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel Spectral Directed Graph Auto-Encoder SDGAE that achieves state-of-the-art average performance on DirLinkBench. Finally, we analyze key factors influencing directed link prediction and highlight open challenges in this field.</p></details> | Preprint |
