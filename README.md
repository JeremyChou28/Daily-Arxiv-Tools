| **[Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00221v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Projection of Extant Refugee and Asylum Seeker Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06857v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimates of future migration patterns are of broad interest in demography. Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. Focusing on refugees and asylum seekers, we propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting refugee population official statistics by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee and asylum seeker populations following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries of origin of large refugee and asylum seeker population.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Synthetic Data Generation for Industrial Bioprocess Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17688v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scarcity and sparsity in bio-manufacturing poses challenges for accurate model development, process monitoring, and optimization. We aim to replicate and capture the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) to generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). This methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling, forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management by reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess data. We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation. The data generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data. This intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new frontiers in data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive fields, for use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or for use in predictive control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formally Exploring Time-Series Anomaly Detection Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17562v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37 widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter requirements.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17414v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17406v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |
| **[RINS-T: Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17396v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/RINS-T.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Disentanglement Beyond Static vs. Dynamic: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Multi-Factor Sequential Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17313v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Deep Clustering for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20840v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings. This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08445v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 25 figures, 35 tables, NeurIPS 2025 accepted</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17155v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fighter: Unveiling the Graph Convolutional Nature of Transformers in Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17106v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Primer on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16940v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Attention: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Environmental Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14050v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health and environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Channel Matters: Estimating Channel Influence for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14763v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence function serves as an efficient post-hoc interpretability tool that quantifies the impact of training data modifications on model parameters, enabling enhanced model performance, improved generalization, and interpretability insights without the need for expensive retraining processes. Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. While channel extremely matters to MTS tasks, channel-centric methods are still largely under-explored for MTS. Particularly, no previous work studied the effects of channel information of MTS in order to explore counterfactual effects between these channels and model performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Channel-wise Influence (ChInf) method that is the first to estimate the influence of different channels in MTS. Based on ChInf,we naturally derived two channel-wise algorithms by incorporating ChInf into classic MTS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ChInf and ChInf-based methods in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS data pruning. Specifically, our ChInf-based methods rank top-1 among all methods for comparison, while previous influence functions do not perform well on MTS anomaly detection tasks and MTS data pruning problem. This fully supports the superiority and necessity of ChInf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance. Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolution-Aware Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16695v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context. Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

| **[Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictability of Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Prediction-Powered Inference through Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16166v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction-powered inference is a recent methodology for the safe use of black-box ML models to impute missing data, strengthening inference of statistical parameters. However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |

We present a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (BDARMA) model for monthly shares of hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, wood, municipal waste, and biofuels from January 2010 to January 2025. The mean vector follows a parsimonious VAR(2) in additive-log-ratio space, while the Dirichlet concentration parameter combines an intercept with ten Fourier harmonics, letting predictive dispersion expand or contract with the seasons. A 61-split rolling-origin study generates twelve-month density forecasts from January 2019 to January 2024. Relative to three benchmarks, a Gaussian VAR(2) in transform space, a seasonal naive copy of last year's proportions, and a drift-free additive-log-ratio random walk, BDARMA lowers the mean continuous ranked probability score by fifteen to sixty percent, achieves component-wise ninety percent interval coverage close to nominal, and matches Gaussian VAR point accuracy through eight months with a maximum loss of 0.02 Aitchison units thereafter. BDARMA therefore delivers sharp, well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts of multivariate renewable-energy shares without sacrificing point precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronos-2: From Univariate to Universal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15821v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A nonstationary seasonal Dynamic Factor Model: an application to temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15667v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific fields, such as agriculture, temperature time series are of interest both as explanatory variables and as objects of study in their own right. However, at the state level, incorporating information from all possible locations in an analysis can be overwhelming, while using a summary measure, such as the state-wide average temperature, can result in significant information loss. In this context, using Dynamic Factor Models (DFMs) provides a compelling alternative for analyzing such multivariate time series, as they allow for the extraction of a small number of common factors that capture the majority of the variability in the data. Given that temperature series are typically seasonal, this study applies a nonstationary seasonal DFM to analyze a multivariate temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais. The results show that the data can be effectively represented by two seasonal factors: the first captures the general seasonal pattern of the state, while the second contrasts the months of highest annual temperatures between two distinct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented on the XVII MGEST (Lavras, Brazil - 2025)</p></details> |
| **[TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Nonstationarity in Time Series: A Deterministic Trend Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07987v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper challenges the dominance of stochastic trend models by introducing the Seasonal-Trend-Stationary ARMA (STSA) framework, which models univariate nonstationary time series as stationary fluctuations around deterministic trend and seasonal components, incorporating a finite number of structural breaks. We propose methods for estimating the locations and numbers of breaks using a modified dynamic programming algorithm and a sequential prediction-interval procedure, and we outline strategies for specifying and estimating the full model. Empirical analysis of U.S. Retail Sales (2004-2025) shows that the STSA model accurately identifies structural breaks corresponding to major economic events, including the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 downturn. The decomposition into trend, seasonal, and ARMA components provides a realistic and interpretable representation of the underlying dynamics of the economic cycle, offering insights into the pace of growth within each regime, recurring seasonal patterns, and the persistence of short-term fluctuations. Although designed primarily for interpretability, STSA substantially outperforms Prophet and achieves forecasting accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art stochastic trend models (ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, Theta) on the M4 Competition monthly dataset, with particular advantages for series exhibiting abrupt structural changes, where stochastic models typically struggle to adapt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Streaming Time Series Forecasting with Adaptive Windowing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15404v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency, particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data, eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |

Our approach involves converting spatial data into one-dimensional time series using space-filling Hilbert curves. We then apply ordinal pattern-based tests for serial dependence to this series. Because Hilbert curves preserve spatial locality, spatial dependence in the original field manifests as serial dependence in the transformed sequence. The approach is easy to implement, accommodates arbitrary grid sizes through generalized Hilbert (``gilbert'') curves, and naturally extends beyond three dimensions. This provides a practical and general alternative to existing methods based on spatial ordinal patterns, which are typically limited to two-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence Modeling with Spectral Mean Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15366v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |

Yet its potential is underutilized in spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability. Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth surface processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper in ICMLA 2025 (Special Session 1: Deep Learning and Applications)</p></details> |

Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |

Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

Although contemporary machine learning has achieved successes, it is not clear that these approaches are optimal: new model classes may further enhance performance and data efficiency. We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency. These results show that hybrid quantum models address key challenges in photovoltaic power forecasting and offer a practical route to more reliable, data-efficient energy predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting, designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received comparatively less attention. Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We develop a Bayesian framework based on the Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling threshold exceedances, providing posterior distributions for the GP parameters and tail quantiles in time series. Two cases are considered: extrapolation of tail quantiles for the stationary marginal distribution under beta-mixing dependence, and dynamic, past-conditional tail quantiles in heteroscedastic regression models. The proposal yields asymptotically honest credible regions, whose coverage probabilities converge to their nominal levels. We establish the asymptotic theory for the Bayesian procedure, deriving conditions on the prior distributions under which the posterior satisfies key asymptotic properties. To achieve this, we first develop a likelihood theory under serial dependence, providing local and global bounds for the empirical log-likelihood process of the misspecified GP model and deriving corresponding asymptotic properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Simulations demonstrate that our Bayesian credible regions outperform naive Bayesian and MLE-based confidence regions across several standard time series models, including ARMA, GARCH, and Markovian copula models. Two real-data applications-to U.S. interest rates and Swiss electricity demand-highlight the relevance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models, underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset, improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Calibration Sample Selection and Forecast Combination in Electricity Price Forecasting: An Application of the ARHNN Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15011v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calibration sample selection and forecast combination are two simple yet powerful tools used in forecasting. They can be combined with a variety of models to significantly improve prediction accuracy, at the same time offering easy implementation and low computational complexity. While their effectiveness has been repeatedly confirmed in prior scientific literature, the topic is still underexplored in the field of electricity price forecasting. In this research article we apply the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN) method to three long-term time series describing the German, Spanish and New England electricity markets. We show that it outperforms popular literature benchmarks in terms of forecast accuracy by up to 10%. We also propose two simplified variants of the method, granting a vast decrease in computation time with only minor loss of prediction accuracy. Finally, we compare the forecasts' performance in a battery storage system trading case study. We find that using a forecast-driven strategy can achieve up to 80% of theoretical maximum profits while trading, demonstrating business value in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

We study seasonal grazing detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Prediction of Adverse Events in Medical Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14286v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new, relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms, and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the parameter estimation as a Bayesian inverse problem. We consider a parametrized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is the FitzHugh--Nagumo model. The considered problem exhibits significant mathematical and computational challenges for classical parameter estimation methods, including strong nonlinearities, nonconvexity, and sharp gradients. We explore how NNs overcome these challenges by approximating reconstruction maps for parameter estimation from observational data. The considered data are time series of the spiking membrane potential of a biological neuron. We infer parameters controlling the dynamics of the model, noise parameters of autocorrelated additive noise, and noise modeled via stochastic differential equations, as well as the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution to expose parameter uncertainties--all with just one forward evaluation of an appropriate NN. We report results for different NN architectures and study the influence of noise on prediction accuracy. We also report timing results for training NNs on dedicated hardware. Our results demonstrate that NNs are a versatile tool to estimate parameters of the dynamical system, stochastic processes, as well as uncertainties, as they propagate through the governing ODE.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 16 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |

Effective portfolio management requires models that can reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level, offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level. TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons, and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights.

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyber-Resilient System Identification for Power Grid through Bayesian Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14043v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multifractality and its sources in the digital currency market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13785v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifractality in time series analysis characterizes the presence of multiple scaling exponents, indicating heterogeneous temporal structures and complex dynamical behaviors beyond simple monofractal models. In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13654v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a gate-based QRC for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively, performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and, interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.</p></details> |  |

This traditional approach tends to prioritize one error indicator, which can bias results when metrics provide contradictory signals. In this context, the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF) is proposed as a multi-metric framework for hyperparameter optimization that integrates explanatory power (R2), sensitivity to extreme errors (RMSE), and average accuracy (MAE). The performance of HEF was assessed using four widely recognized benchmark datasets in the forecasting domain: the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets. Prediction models were optimized through Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and statistical analyses based on difference-of-proportions tests confirmed that HEF delivers superior results compared to a unimetric reference function, regardless of the optimizer employed, with particular relevance for heterogeneous monthly time series (M3) and highly granular daily demand scenarios (M5). The findings demonstrate that HEF improves stability, generalization, and robustness at a low computational cost, consolidating its role as a reliable evaluation framework that enhances model selection, enables more accurate demand forecasts, and supports decision-making in dynamic and competitive business environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 25 tables.

Unlike classical approaches in statistical inference, our approach avoids explicitly estimating the conditional probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count processes, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. We provide a margin condition that controls the rate of convergence for the risk. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the convergence rate of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, re-submitted.

However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions.

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2) We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs.

Consequently, the Granger causality test has become one of the main concerns of the econometrician for decades. Taking advantage of the theoretical breakthroughs in deep learning in recent years, we propose a doubly robust Granger causality test (DRGCT). Our method offers several key advantages. The first and most direct benefit is for the users, DRGCT allows them to handle large lag orders while alleviating the curse of dimensionality that traditional nonlinear Granger causality tests usually face. Second, introducing a doubly robust test statistic for time series based on neural networks that achieves a parametric convergence rate not only suggests a new paradigm for nonparametric inference in econometrics, but also broadens the application scope of deep learning. Third, a multiplier bootstrap method, combined with the doubly robust approach, provides an efficient way to obtain critical values, effectively reducing computational time and avoiding redundant calculations. We prove that the test asymptotically controls the type I error, while achieving power approaches one, and validate the effectiveness of our test through numerical simulations. In real data analysis, we apply DRGCT to revisit the price-volume relationship problem in the stock markets of America, China, and Japan.</p></details> |  |

Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13029v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition, trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></details> |  |

| **[CoRA: Covariate-Aware Adaptation of Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12681v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the thirty-ninth annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano. Code and models are available at https://github.com/vefalun/NanoHTNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TIP 2025, Open Sourced</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MRS 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby quadratically reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM keeps the pretrained LLM backbone frozen, yielding faster training and lower memory usage. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

This demands integrated models that jointly capture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and behavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic forecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally responsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization framework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine supply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective infection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports coordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two formulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model that leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved mitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable heuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The model is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based forecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models under data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more than 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while significantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions. Our framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with vaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic policies. Fairness improves overall efficiency in the long term by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations, leading to better long-term public health outcomes. The model offers policymakers a scalable and operationally relevant tool to strengthen preparedness and ensure a more effective and equitable response to epidemics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing in the Dark: A Teacher-Student Framework for Dark Video Action Recognition via Knowledge Distillation and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03724v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition in dark or low-light (under-exposed) videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

| **[Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> |  |
| **[T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

| **[NeurIPT: Foundation Model for Neural Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16548v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

| **[EDVD-LLaMA: Explainable Deepfake Video Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16442v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traces Propagation: Memory-Efficient and Scalable Forward-Only Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13053v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients. However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning. Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient, scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes. Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way for efficient learning at the edge.</p></details> |  |

We show that STEMMED can be decomposed node-by-node, suggesting a tractable distributed learning procedure. Simulation shows that this learning algorithm can accurately recover known parameters of STEMMED, especially for small networks and long data-horizons. Next, we turn this node-by-node decomposition into an online cooperative multi-period forecasting framework, which is asymptotically robust to operational errors, to facilitate Opioid-related overdose death (OOD) trends forecasting among neighboring communities. In our numerical study, we parameterize STEMMED using individual-level OOD data and county-level demographics in Massachusetts. For any node, we observe that OODs within the same drug class from nearby locations have the greatest influence on future OOD trends. Furthermore, the expected proportion of OODs triggered by historical events varies greatly across counties, ranging between 30%-70%. Finally, in a practical online forecasting setting, STEMMED-based cooperative framework reduces prediction error by 60% on average, compared to well-established forecasting models. Leveraging the growing abundance of public health surveillance data, STEMMED can provide accurate forecasts of local OOD trends and highlight complex interactions between OODs across communities and drug types. Moreover, STEMMED enhances synergies between local and federal government entities, which is critical to designing impactful policy interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Scene Prompting for Scene-Consistent Camera-Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14945v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT.

Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions. Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures.

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

To put it in detail, it links the age-standardized years of disability adjustment with 18 world development indicators across economic, educational, social and information technology sectors. Then, by means of Pearson correlation, mutual information, Granger causality and maximum information coefficient and other methods, the linear, nonlinear and lagged dependency relationships were evaluated. After research, it was found that there is a very prominent spatio-temporal heterogeneity among young people aged 20 to 39, and the coupling relationship is stronger. From the overall situation, education corresponds to a low burden. Unemployment corresponds to a high burden. Through lag analysis, it can be known that the influence time of economic and technological factors is relatively short, while that of educational factors is relatively long. These results highlight the macro determinants that play a role at different time scales and also provide population-level references for verifying computational mental health models and for intervention measures in specific regions and for specific ages.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICDM workshop</p></details> |

However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/mvcustom</p></details> |

This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

| **[Decision-focused Sensing and Forecasting for Adaptive and Rapid Flood Response: An Implicit Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16015v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response, yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained disaster response tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption. Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns. We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method. Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches. Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention. Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence. Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest. These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity. Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | 32 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tamu-visual-ai.github.io/usplat4d/</p></details> |

The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables in the main paper and one figure and table in the appendix.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time.

| **[Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection</p></details> |

| **[Open Vocabulary Multi-Label Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09073v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap. On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages (main), 70 pages incl. appendices; figures & tables as in manuscript.

However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts.

A two-stage modelling framework was used: Lasso was used to identify a parsimonious set of socio economic and health-service covariates, and a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model incorporated these predictors with structured spatial and temporal random effects. This research demonstrates that socio-economic disadvantage and service accessibility drive EE-O/A incidence, underscoring the need for targeted mental-health interventions and resource allocation in impoverished FNQ communities. Limitations include reliance on cross-sectional census data for covariates and potential ecological bias from data fusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, safe and efficient navigation in cluttered environments remains challenging due to partial observability, turbidity, the limited field-of-view of forward-looking sonar (FLS), and occlusions that obscure obstacle geometry. To address these issues, we propose the Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance Strategy (EROAS), a lightweight framework that augments a standard 2D FLS with a pivoting mechanism, effectively transforming it into a cost-efficient \emph{2.5D sonar}. This design provides vertical information on demand, extending situational awareness while minimizing computational overhead. EROAS integrates three complementary modules: first, Sonar Profile-guided Directional Decision Control (SPD2C) for rapid gap detection and generation of reference commands in both horizontal and vertical planes. Secondly, the Spatial Context Generator (SCG), which maintains a short-term obstacle memory of the past to mitigate partial observability, and finally, a Spatio-Temporal Control Barrier Function (ST-CBF) that enforces forward-invariance of safety constraints by filtering nominal references. Together, these components enable robust, reactive avoidance of obstacles in uncertain and cluttered 3D underwater settings. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed EROAS algorithm, demonstrating improved trajectory efficiency, reduced travel time, and enhanced safety compared to conventional methods such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Artificial Potential Fields (APF). https://github.com/AIRLabIISc/EROAS</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Video-STR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning with Relation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10976v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PruneGCRN: Minimizing and explaining spatio-temporal problems through node pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10803v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used. These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their most important elements.</p></details> |  |

Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative architectures.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version, work in progress</p></details> |

GrifFinNet constructs inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics.

Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881, outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3) In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR.

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recently, some compressed video SR methods attempt to exploit the spatio-temporal information in the frequency domain, showing great promise in super-resolution performance. However, these methods do not differentiate various frequency subbands spatially or capture the temporal frequency dynamics, potentially leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-based compressed video SR model (FCVSR) consisting of a motion-guided adaptive alignment (MGAA) network and a multi-frequency feature refinement (MFFR) module. Additionally, a frequency-aware contrastive loss is proposed for training FCVSR, in order to reconstruct finer spatial details. The proposed model has been evaluated on three public compressed video super-resolution datasets, with results demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to existing works in terms of super-resolution performance (up to a 0.14dB gain in PSNR over the second-best model) and complexity.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |
| **[IONext: Unlocking the Next Era of Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17089v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU), which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry (IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by 10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geo-Aware Models for Stream Temperature Prediction across Different Spatial Regions and Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09500v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making.</p></details> |  |

While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility. The project's documentation, including source code, CAD models, and dataset links, is publicly available at https://snt-arg.github.io/smapper_docs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[HoliTom: Holistic Token Merging for Fast Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21334v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code link: https://github.com/cokeshao/HoliTom</p></details> |

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGSPATIAL 2025 - GeoAI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Decentralized Multi-Robot Relative Navigation in Unknown, Structurally Constrained Environments under Limited Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09188v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication. Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient, trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Captions to Keyframes: KeyScore for Multimodal Frame Scoring and Video-Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06509v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting informative keyframes is critical for efficient video understanding, yet existing approaches often rely on heuristics, ignore semantics, or produce redundant frames. We propose KeyScore, a caption-aware frame scoring method that combines three complementary signals: semantic similarity to captions, temporal representativeness, and contextual drop impact. Applied to large-scale video-caption datasets, KeyScore generates frame-level importance scores that enable training keyframe extractors or guiding video-language models. To support this, we also propose STACFP, a Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering method that generates diverse and compact frame proposals across long videos. Together, KeyScore and STACFP reduce uninformative frames while preserving critical content, resulting in faster and more accurate inference. Our experiments on three standard video-language benchmarks (MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo) show that combining STACFP and KeyScore enables up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame processing, while outperforming uniform 8-frame encoders in video-text retrieval, keyframe extraction, and action recognition tasks. By focusing on semantically relevant frames, our method enhances both efficiency and performance, enabling scalable and caption-grounded video understanding.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

To explore general spatial imagination capability, we present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct a dataset for aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase schedule to train a foundation model--initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge--into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that AirScape significantly outperforms existing foundation models in 3D spatial imagination capabilities, especially with over a 50% improvement in metrics reflecting motion alignment.

| **[GL-DT: Multi-UAV Detection and Tracking with Global-Local Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09092v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However, complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.</p></details> |  |

Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALISE: Annotation-Free LiDAR Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05752v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal, multi-field deep learning of shock propagation in meso-structured media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16139v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected materials is a key challenge in planetary defense and in the pursuit of inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating - phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition - has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields - pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components - into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. MSTM reduces mean-squared error and structural dissimilarity by 94% relative torelative to single-field spatio-temporal models. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |
| **[PO-CKAN:Physics Informed Deep Operator Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Chunk Rational Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08795v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters, initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers' equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/videocanvas</p></details> |

In the nonlinear setting, the discretized equations are solved with a preconditioned residual iteration based on a global linearization. The linear(ized) equation systems are approximately solved parallel-in-time using a block preconditioner applied in the characteristic variables of the underlying linear(ized) hyperbolic PDE. This change of variables is motivated by the observation that inter-variable coupling for characteristic variables is weak relative to intra-variable coupling, at least locally where spatio-temporal variations in the eigenvectors of the associated flux Jacobian are sufficiently small. For an $\ell$-dimensional system of PDEs, applying the preconditioner consists of solving a sequence of $\ell$ scalar linear(ized)-advection-like problems, each being associated with a different characteristic wave-speed in the underlying linear(ized) PDE. We approximately solve these linear advection problems using multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT); however, any other suitable parallel-in-time method could be used. Numerical examples are shown for the (linear) acoustics equations in heterogeneous media, and for the (nonlinear) shallow water equations and Euler equations of gas dynamics with shocks and rarefactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal-accepted version of paper, including link to published article.

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams. Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing</p></details> | Journal Submission |

Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at https://trafficwaves.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

| **[Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04910v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structure-Preserving Assessment of VBPBB for Time Series Imputation Under Periodic Trends, Noise, and Missingness Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19535v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete time series data present significant challenges to accurate statistical analysis, particularly when the underlying data exhibit periodic structures such as seasonal or monthly trends. Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSD-TS: Exploring the Potential of Linear State Space Models for Diffusion Models in Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets. Our datasets and code are available at \href{https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SSD-TS/}{https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SSD-TS/}</p></details> | KDD' 25 |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: A Versatile Method for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet they occur frequently in applications. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike most existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for empirical applications even with nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. Furthermore, our method mitigates the distributional bias common among many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. We establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering both linear and nonlinear time series and an analysis on a real-world groundwater dataset, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |
| **[CoSTI: Consistency Models for (a faster) Spatio-Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19364v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Imputation (MTSI) is crucial for many applications, such as healthcare monitoring and traffic management, where incomplete data can compromise decision-making. Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Impute With Confidence: A Framework for Uncertainty Aware Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09353v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data with missing values is common across many domains. Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIM-SUM: Dynamic IMputation for Smart Utility Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20023v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values. However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSCD: Lomb-Scargle Conditioned Diffusion for Time series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17039v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Functions for Learning Periodic Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09526v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04059v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks. Codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE.

Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts.

Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |

Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis.

| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[How Deep is your Guess? A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06652v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

Despite their strengths, they struggle with capturing high-dimensional distributions and cross-feature dependencies. Recent work explores generative approaches using diffusion or flow-based models, extending to time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability remains a challenge. This work proposes a novel method combining recurrent neural networks' efficiency with diffusion models' probabilistic modeling, based on stochastic interpolants and conditional generation with control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference.

| **[Score-CDM: Score-Weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13075v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariant time series (MTS) data are usually incomplete in real scenarios, and imputing the incomplete MTS is practically important to facilitate various time series mining tasks. Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImDiffusion: Imputed Diffusion Models for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00754v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is of paramount importance for ensuring the efficient operation of large-scale systems across diverse domains. However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, which conducts projections onto every other marginal alternatingly. However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data. We show that optimizing the transport cost improves the performance and the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art result in healthcare and environmental data while exhibiting the advantage of exploring both temporal and feature patterns in probabilistic time series imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining multitemporal optical and SAR data for LAI imputation with BiLSTM network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07434v1)** | 2023-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is vital for predicting winter wheat yield. Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Networked Time Series Imputation via Position-aware Graph Enhanced Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18612v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework based on the principles of recurrent neural networks and neural stochastic differential equations for reconciling irregularly sampled measurements. We impute measurements at any arbitrary timescale and quantify the uncertainty in the imputations in a principled manner. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantifying and propagating the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across time instants. Our experiments on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution system reveal that our framework can outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification approaches for time-series data imputations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Time-Series Imputation with Wasserstein Interpolation for Optimal Look-Ahead-Bias and Variance Tradeoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12736v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing time-series data is a prevalent practical problem. Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.</p></details> |  |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |

While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines.

These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure.

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |

For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world problems data has missing values, which may difficult the application of machine learning techniques to extract information. In this paper we focus on the task of imputation of time series. Many imputation methods for time series are based on regression methods. Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly when the variables are categorical. To address this case, we propose a new imputation method based on Expectation Maximization over dynamic Bayesian networks. The approach is assessed with synthetic and real data, and it outperforms several state-of-the art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master paper, draft to be submitted</p></details> |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-IMM, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Missing: Variable-Aware Representation Learning for Irregular EHR Time Series using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22121v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix Information with History Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01474v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Solar Flare Prediction Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |
| **[ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03310v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures V3: Revised significantly.

Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations.

In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD.

| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v6)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19341v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqLink: A Robust Neural-ODE Architecture for Modelling Partially Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03560v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models have become popular as foundation models for solving many time series problems. Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks.

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Deep Efficient Continuous Manifold Learning for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03379v2)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling non-Euclidean data is drawing extensive attention along with the unprecedented successes of deep neural networks in diverse fields. Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUTS+: High-dimensional Causal Discovery from Irregular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05890v2)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series is a fundamental problem in the machine learning community, enabling causal reasoning and decision-making in complex scenarios. Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |
| **[Time-Parameterized Convolutional Neural Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03210v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Time Evidential Distributions for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13503v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent in many real-world settings such as healthcare, irregular time series are challenging to formulate predictions from. It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

| **[Warpformer: A Multi-scale Modeling Approach for Irregular Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09368v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in various fields, particularly in healthcare, and exhibit two key characteristics: intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learnable Path in Neural Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04333v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs), which are continuous analogues to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are a specialized model in (irregular) time-series processing. In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Time series data types can be broadly classified into regular or irregular. However, there are no existing generative models that show good performance for both types without any model changes. Therefore, we present a general purpose model capable of synthesizing regular and irregular time series data. To our knowledge, we are the first designing a general purpose time series synthesis model, which is one of the most challenging settings for time series synthesis. To this end, we design a generative adversarial network-based method, where many related techniques are carefully integrated into a single framework, ranging from neural ordinary/controlled differential equations to continuous time-flow processes.

Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |

Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |

Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |

Hence, a model that combines the use of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and RNN was proposed (ODE-RNN) to model irregular time series with higher accuracy, but it suffers from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |

Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Convolutions: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Raw Seismic Data Ingestion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13631v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional seismic processing workflows (SPW) are expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Integration Learning for Irregularly-sampled Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09986v2)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) data is sparse and irregular as it is recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926v2)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Model for Demand and Supply Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12469v1)** | 2020-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for demand forecasting only focus on modeling the temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

Recent works address this issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.</p></details> |  |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> |  |

However, most convergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target distribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions: weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential integrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based generative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic data distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees for the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the empirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a practical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing hyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairGen: Enhancing Fairness in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Self-Discovering Latent Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18810v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various image generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in the training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model retraining with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets, demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17414v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented and published at Ethics and Aesthetics of Artificial Intelligence Conference (EA-AI'25)</p></details> |

However, beyond mere detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary OOD detection to a more granular detection.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 6 Figures |
| **[Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05231v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach, Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations. On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost -- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[CharDiff: A Diffusion Model with Character-Level Guidance for License Plate Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17330v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction via Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13297v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We introduce LangTraj, a language-conditioned scene-diffusion model that simulates the joint behavior of all agents in traffic scenarios. By conditioning on natural language inputs, LangTraj provides flexible and intuitive control over interactive behaviors, generating nuanced and realistic scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision. Validated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, LangTraj demonstrates strong performance in realism, language controllability, and language-conditioned safety-critical simulation, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and scalable autonomous vehicle testing.

| **[From Preferences to Prejudice: The Role of Alignment Tuning in Shaping Social Bias in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17247v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17206v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.</p></details> |  |

Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20977v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.

To address these challenges, we propose KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input. Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE (KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their kinematic properties.</p></details> |  |

The popular classifier-free guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction. We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16091v6)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models are available at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Fidelity for Pre-Trained-Diffusion-Based Low-Light Image Enhancement via Condition Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17105v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding, i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors. Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Diffusion Model without Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15301v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations. Code and interpretations are available at https://howlin-wang.github.io/svg/.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on \emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space, causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process; \emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach, \textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geodesic Diffusion Models for Efficient Medical Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00745v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a forward process, where samples are progressively perturbed with Gaussian noise according to a predefined noise schedule. From a geometric perspective, each noise schedule corresponds to a unique trajectory in probability space from the data distribution to a Gaussian prior. However, prior diffusion models rely on empirically chosen schedules that may not be optimal. This inefficiency necessitates many intermediate time steps, resulting in high computational costs during both training and sampling. To address this, we derive a family of geodesic noise schedules corresponding to the shortest paths in probability space under the Fisher-Rao metric. Based on these schedules, we propose Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs), which significantly improve training and sampling efficiency by minimizing the energy required to transform between probability distributions. This efficiency further enables sampling to start from an intermediate distribution in conditional image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results with as few as 6 steps. We evaluated GDM on two medical image enhancement tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by 20- to 30-fold compared to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and 4- to 6-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, and accelerating sampling by 160- to 170-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. These gains support the use of GDM for efficient model development and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/GDM-VE.</p></details> |  |

Distillation methods accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.</p></details> | work in progress |

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Work has been submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongBloom_demo.

However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely, Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance, highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image generation.

Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/HorizonTEL/AIGIBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

But learning and transferring photographic style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/</p></details> |  |

This paper tackles training-free appearance transfer, which produces an image with the structure of a target image from the appearance of a reference image. Existing methods usually do not reflect semantic correspondence, as they rely on query-key similarity within the self-attention layer to establish correspondences between images. To this end, we propose explicitly rearranging the features according to the dense semantic correspondences. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method in various aspects: preserving the structure of the target and reflecting the correct color from the reference, even when the two images are not aligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page : https://sooyeon-go.github.io/eye_for_an_eye/</p></details> |

Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.</p></details> |  |

Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. 23 pages, with the appendix</p></details> |

However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead. Experimental results confirm that Free$^2$Guide using image-trained LVLMs significantly improves text-to-video alignment, thereby enhancing the overall video quality.

The rise of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations, these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies, our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains, including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 20 figures, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models as Constrained Samplers for Optimization with Unknown Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18012v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging when analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[SDAR: A Synergistic Diffusion-AutoRegression Paradigm for Scalable Sequence Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06303v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report. 40 pages, Inference speedup analysis added</p></details> |
| **[Dual Caption Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06023v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in human preference optimization, originally developed for Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in improving text-to-image diffusion models. These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, within the existing preference datasets, the original caption often does not clearly favor the preferred image over the alternative, which weakens the supervision signal available during training. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a data augmentation and optimization framework that reinforces the learning signal by assigning two distinct captions to each preference pair. This encourages the model to better differentiate between preferred and less-preferred outcomes during training. We also construct Pick-Double Caption, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for each image, and propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Optimization with Diffusion Models for Green Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05730v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | UAI 2025 |

Deepfake Detection in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16556v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are widely regarded as relying on autoregressive models (ARMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA employs a forward data masking process and a reverse generation process, parameterized by a Transformer to predict masked tokens. It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings show the promise of diffusion models for language modeling at scale and challenge the common assumption that core LLM capabilities discussed above inherently depend on ARMs. Project page and codes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To tackle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception information without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we incorporate geometry and perception priors to initialize the Gaussian branches and guide their parameter optimization. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we introduce a stable Score Distillation Sampling for fine-grained prior distillation to ensure effective knowledge transfer. The model is further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experimental results show that we outperform existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional agent models often rely on rigid behavioral rules and lack semantic understanding of textual content, while emerging large language model (LLM)-based agents incur prohibitive computational costs at scale. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid simulation framework that strategically integrates LLM-driven agents with diffusion model-based agents. The framework employs LLM-based agents to simulate a core subset of users with rich semantic reasoning, while a diffusion model handles the remaining population efficiently. Although the two agent types operate on disjoint user groups, both incorporate key factors including user personalization, social influence, and content awareness, and interact through a coordinated simulation process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, validating the effectiveness of its modular design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we conduct causal tracing to reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics, averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.</p></details> |  |

However, the generation process remains computationally intensive, and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5, while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear, while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$ resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons, Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training. Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16321v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> |

We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages + references, 13 figures. v2: Corrected a conceptual error in Sec. 4</p></details> |

However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug.

Although longitudinal imaging constitutes much of clinical MRI, leveraging previous scans is challenging due to the complex relationship between scan sessions, potentially involving substantial anatomical or pathological changes, and the lack of open-access datasets with both longitudinal pairs and raw k-space needed for training deep learning-based reconstruction models. Methods: We propose a diffusion-model-based reconstruction framework that eliminates the need for longitudinally paired training data. During training, we treat all scan timepoints as samples from the same distribution, therefore requiring only standalone images. At inference, our framework integrates a subject's prior scan in magnitude DICOM format, which is readily available in clinical workflows, to guide reconstruction of the follow-up. To support future development, we introduce an open-access clinical dataset containing multi-session pairs including prior DICOMs and follow-up k-space. Results: Our method consistently outperforms both longitudinal and non-longitudinal baseline reconstruction methods across various accelerated Cartesian acquisition strategies. In imaging regions highly similar to the prior scan, we observe up to 10\% higher SSIM and 2 dB higher PSNR, without degradation in dissimilar areas. Compared to longitudinal reconstruction baselines, our method demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of anatomical change and misregistration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that prior scans can be effectively integrated with state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction methods to improve image quality and enable greater scan acceleration, without requiring an extensive longitudinally-paired training dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskControl: Spatio-Temporal Control for Masked Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10780v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in motion diffusion models have enabled spatially controllable text-to-motion generation. However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |
| **[MGE-LDM: Joint Latent Diffusion for Simultaneous Music Generation and Source Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23305v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

| **[GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16136v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Compressed and Smooth Latent Space for Text Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21170v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control; however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

| **[Learning density ratios in causal inference using Bregman-Riesz regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16127v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ratio of two probability density functions is a fundamental quantity that appears in many areas of statistics and machine learning, including causal inference, reinforcement learning, covariate shift, outlier detection, independence testing, importance sampling, and diffusion modeling. Naively estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g., kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution. Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repli...</summary><p>Replication code is available from https://github.com/CI-NYC/densityratios</p></details> |

Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures.

BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.</p></details> |  |

The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning What Matters: Steering Diffusion via Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09660v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

As future wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, the accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, based on the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. We then design an innovative dual diffusion model (DM)-based large artificial intelligence framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RadioDiff-$k^2$ framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both image-level RM construction and localization tasks, while maintaining inference latency within a few hundred milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Conditions for Diffusion models in Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15510v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://orca-rc.github.io/</p></details> |

While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness.

Framed through the unifying perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis of Shashank Gupta defended at the University of Amsterdam on October 13th 2025</p></details> |

Both categories of datasets exhibit inadequacies in furnishing adequate human identities and authentic in-the-wild background scenes, which are crucial for accurately simulating real-world distributions. In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to CG-rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes. We propose an effective data generation pipeline based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g, text captions, the depth map, and surface normal images. To generate a wide variety of human images with initial labels, we train a customized, multi-condition ControlNet model. The key to this process is using a 3D parametric model, e.g, SMPL-X, to create various condition inputs easily. Our data generation pipeline is both flexible and customizable, making it adaptable to multiple real-world tasks, such as human interaction in complex scenes and humans captured by wide-angle lenses. By relying solely on generative models, we can produce large-scale, in-the-wild human images with high-quality annotations, significantly reducing the need for manual image collection and annotation.

Despite its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

| **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025, 36 pages, 18 figures</p></details> |

Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional GLMMs for reaction times in choice tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15203v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study connects two methods for modeling reaction times (RTs) in choice tasks: (1) the first-hitting time of a simple diffusion model with a single barrier, representing the cognitive process leading to a response, and (2) Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We achieve this by analyzing RT distributions conditioned on each response alternative. Because certain diffusion model variants yield Inverse Gaussian (IG) and Gamma distributions for first-hitting times, we can justify using these distributions in RT models. Conversely, employing IG and Gamma distributions within GLMMs allows us to infer the underlying cognitive processes. We demonstrate this concept through simulations and apply it to previously published real-world data. Finally, we discuss the scope and potential extensions of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code : https://github.com/sunwoocho/SRDD</p></details> |

However, the models still struggle with following detailed editing prompts or performing local edits. Specifically, global image quality often deteriorates immediately after a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and consistently improves image quality during more than 100 editing steps, while keeping the unedited regions intact. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. On a challenging realistic image-editing dataset, SPICE quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is consistently preferred by human annotators. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to NeurIPS Creative AI Track 2025.

To train this model, we create a large-scale multiview-consistent dataset of 3D geometry and appearance by applying state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction techniques to existing multiview image datasets.

| **[Policy Transfer Ensures Fast Learning for Continuous-Time LQR with Entropy Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15165v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models. This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL, addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete to continuous time settings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep generative priors for 3D brain analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15119v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.</p></details> |  |

Active galactic nuclei identification using diffusion-based inpainting of Euclid VIS images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15321v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted as part of the A&A Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 34 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |
| **[Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14978v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nupurkmr9.github.io/npedit/</p></details> |

Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleWeaver: Weaving Efficient Controllable T2I Generation with Multi-Scale Reference Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14882v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency. While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities. However, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to inter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio input. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an autoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure controllability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech sounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes, enabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further accelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples semantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized Phoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and English (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[FraQAT: Quantization Aware Training with Fractional bits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14823v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana, \pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).</p></details> |  |

A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE) and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning.

| **[Model Metamers Reveal Invariances in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17378v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks (GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

However, effective fashion recommendation demands precise service for each customer with a deeper cognition of fashion. In this paper, we conduct the first study on fashion cognitive learning, which is fashion recommendations conditioned on personal physical information. To this end, we propose a Fashion Cognitive Network (FCN) to learn the relationships among visual-semantic embedding of outfit composition and appearance features of individuals. FCN contains two submodules, namely outfit encoder and Multi-label Graph Neural Network (ML-GCN). The outfit encoder uses a convolutional layer to encode an outfit into an outfit embedding. The latter module learns label classifiers via stacked GCN. We conducted extensive experiments on the newly collected O4U dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence that our framework outperforms alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness in Text-Attributed Graph Learning: Insights, Trade-offs, and New Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17185v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Heterogeneous Continual Graph Learning via Meta-Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17458v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v6)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies face a vast hypothesis space, while interventions such as gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. To accelerate such experiments, gene perturbation models predict the transcriptional outcome of interventions. Since constructing the training set is challenging, active learning is often employed in a "lab-in-the-loop" process. While this strategy makes training more targeted, it is substantially slower, as it fails to exploit the inherent parallelizability of Perturb-seq experiments. Here, we focus on graph neural network-based gene perturbation models and propose a subset selection method that, unlike active learning, selects the training perturbations in one shot. Our method chooses the interventions that maximize the propagation of the supervision signal to the model. The selection criterion is defined over the input knowledge graph and is optimized with submodular maximization, ensuring a near-optimal guarantee. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that, in addition to providing months of acceleration compared to active learning, the method improves the stability of perturbation choices while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[UniGTE: Unified Graph-Text Encoding for Zero-Shot Generalization across Graph Tasks and Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16885v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues. UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable graph reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation-guided Interpolation Using Graph Neural Networks for High-Resolution Nowcasting in Switzerland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00017v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1km) and temporal (10 min) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed architecture combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We evaluate two models, one trained using local nowcasting analyses and one trained without, on multiple surface variables and compare it against operational high-resolution NWP (ICON-CH1) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. Results over the test period show that both GNNs consistently outperform ICON-CH1 when verified against INCA analyses across most variables and lead times. Relative to the INCA forecast system, scores against INCA analyses show AI gains beyond 2h (with early-lead disadvantages attributable to INCA's warm start from the analysis), while verification against held-out stations shows no systematic degradation at short lead-times for AI models and frequent outperformance across surface variables. A comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores for precipitation, pairwise significance testing and event-based evaluation, demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains. These results indicate that high-resolution, observation-guided GNNs can match or exceed the skill of established forecasting systems for short lead times, including when they are trained without nowcasting analyses.</p></details> | Updated 19.10.2025 |

However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, raising significant concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, existing defense methods face two main challenges: either the inability to establish a clear distinction between triggers and clean nodes, resulting in the removal of many clean nodes, or the failure to eliminate the impact of triggers, making it challenging to restore the target nodes to their pre-attack state. Through empirical analysis of various existing graph backdoor attacks, we observe that the triggers generated by these methods exhibit over-similarity in both features and structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel graph backdoor defense method SimGuard. We first utilizes a similarity-based metric to detect triggers and then employs contrastive learning to train a backdoor detector that generates embeddings capable of separating triggers from clean nodes, thereby improving detection efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method effectively defends against various graph backdoor attacks while preserving performance on clean nodes. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After discussions with one of the co-authors, it was decided that this version should not be made public at this time.

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, work in progress</p></details> |

Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.</p></details> |  |

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</p></details> |  |

Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |

While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Elsevier Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |
