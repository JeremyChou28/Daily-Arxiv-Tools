Its architecture comprises a fast spectral similarity layer based on cosine similarity metrics of Fourier-transformed signals, and a sparse time-frequency layer for wavelet coherence. The system constructs and evolves a multilayer graph representing inter-signal relationships, enabling low-latency inference and monitoring. A simulation prototype demonstrates functionality across 8 synthetic channels with a high similarity threshold for further computation, with additional opportunities for scaling the architecture up to support thousands of input signals with constrained hardware. Applications discussed include neuroscience, finance, and biomedical signal analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Symposium for Signal Processing 2025</p></details> |
| **[Short-Horizon Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Pumps Using Time-Series Features and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19974v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term faults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The approach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in advance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback periods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window approach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class imbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that the Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance with a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\% at 15 minutes, and 48.6\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random Forest model achieved 57.6\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive accuracy of 65.6\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but slightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history length depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may evolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and scalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time industrial monitoring systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Permutation Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19955v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Permutation Entropy, introduced by Bandt and Pompe, is a widely used complexity measure for real-valued time series that is based on the relative order of values within consecutive segments of fixed length. After standardizing each segment to a permutation and computing the frequency distribution of these permutations, Shannon Entropy is then applied to quantify the series' complexity. We introduce Global Permutation Entropy (GPE), a novel index that considers all possible patterns of a given length, including non-consecutive ones. Its computation relies on recently developed algorithms that enable the efficient extraction of full permutation profiles. We illustrate some properties of GPE and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic datasets, showing that it reveals structural information not accessible through standard permutation entropy. We provide a Julia package for the calculation of GPE at `https://github.com/AThreeH1/Global-Permutation-Entropy'.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[BinConv: A Neural Architecture for Ordinal Encoding in Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in time series forecasting has explored reformulating regression as a classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from more stable training, improved uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding, which ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the target values. As a result, they fail to convey information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we address this limitation by applying \textbf{Cumulative Binary Encoding} (CBE), a monotonic binary representation that transforms both model inputs and outputs. CBE implicitly preserves ordinal and magnitude information, allowing models to learn distance aware representations while operating within a classification framework. To leverage CBE effectively, we propose \textbf{BinConv}, a fully convolutional neural network architecture designed for probabilistic forecasting. We demonstrate that standard fully connected layers are not only less computationally efficient than convolutional layers when used with CBE, but also degrade forecasting performance. Our experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that BinConv achieves superior performance compared to widely used baselines in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Concept Learning over Time Series via Temporal Logic Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03269v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Modeling of Asynchronous Change-Points in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15801v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a novel Bayesian method for asynchronous change-point detection in multivariate time series. This method allows for change-points to occur earlier in some (leading) series followed, after a short delay, by change-points in some other (lagging) series. Such dynamic dependence structure is common in fields such as seismology and neurology where a latent event such as an earthquake or seizure causes certain sensors to register change-points before others. We model these lead-lag dependencies via a latent directed graph and provide a hierarchical prior for learning the graph's structure and parameters. Posterior inference is made tractable by modifying particle MCMC methods designed for univariate change-point problems. We apply our method to both simulated and real datasets from the fields of seismology and neurology. In the simulated data, we find that our method outperforms competing methods in settings where the change-point locations are dependent across series. In the real data applications we show that our model can also uncover interpretable network structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinCast: A Foundation Model for Financial Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19609v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time-series forecasting is critical for maintaining economic stability, guiding informed policymaking, and promoting sustainable investment practices. However, it remains challenging due to various underlying pattern shifts. These shifts arise primarily from three sources: temporal non-stationarity (distribution changes over time), multi-domain diversity (distinct patterns across financial domains such as stocks, commodities, and futures), and varying temporal resolutions (patterns differing across per-second, hourly, daily, or weekly indicators). While recent deep learning methods attempt to address these complexities, they frequently suffer from overfitting and typically require extensive domain-specific fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FinCast, the first foundation model specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on large-scale financial datasets. Remarkably, FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot performance, effectively capturing diverse patterns without domain-specific fine-tuning. Comprehensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FinCast surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Time Series Forecasting of Distributions: A Koopman-Wasserstein Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07570v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for forecasting the temporal evolution of probability distributions observed at discrete time points. Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</p></details> | revised |
| **[A Structure-Preserving Assessment of VBPBB for Time Series Imputation Under Periodic Trends, Noise, and Missingness Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19535v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete time series data present significant challenges to accurate statistical analysis, particularly when the underlying data exhibit periodic structures such as seasonal or monthly trends. Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model for time series modelling and forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00913v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hierarchical Bayesian framework is introduced for developing tree-based mixture models for time series, partly motivated by applications in finance and forecasting. At the top level, meaningful discrete states are identified as appropriately quantised values of some of the most recent samples. At the bottom level, a different, arbitrary base model is associated with each state. This defines a very general framework that can be used in conjunction with any existing model class to build flexible and interpretable mixture models. We call this the Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model, or the BCT-X framework. Appropriate algorithmic tools are described, which allow for effective and efficient Bayesian inference and learning; these algorithms can be updated sequentially, facilitating online forecasting. The utility of the general framework is illustrated in the particular instances when AR or ARCH models are used as base models. The latter results in a mixture model that offers a powerful way of modelling the well-known volatility asymmetries in financial data, revealing a novel, important feature of stock market index data, in the form of an enhanced leverage effect. In forecasting, the BCT-X methods are found to outperform several state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of accuracy and computational requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2106.03023</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning in Mild Cognitive Impairment Diagnosis using Eye Movements and Image Content in Visual Memory Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23016v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050, highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps, achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity). These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized long-term visual memory task.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ReLATE+: Unified Framework for Adversarial Attack Detection, Classification, and Resilient Model Selection in Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19456v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimizing computational overhead in time-series classification, particularly in deep learning models, presents a significant challenge due to the high complexity of model architectures and the large volume of sequential data that must be processed in real time. This challenge is further compounded by adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for resilient methods that ensure robust performance and efficient model selection. To address this challenge, we propose ReLATE+, a comprehensive framework that detects and classifies adversarial attacks, adaptively selects deep learning models based on dataset-level similarity, and thus substantially reduces retraining costs relative to conventional methods that do not leverage prior knowledge, while maintaining strong performance. ReLATE+ first checks whether the incoming data is adversarial and, if so, classifies the attack type, using this insight to identify a similar dataset from a repository and enable the reuse of the best-performing associated model. This approach ensures strong performance while reducing the need for retraining, and it generalizes well across different domains with varying data distributions and feature spaces. Experiments show that ReLATE+ reduces computational overhead by an average of 77.68%, enhancing adversarial resilience and streamlining robust model selection, all without sacrificing performance, within 2.02% of Oracle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE TSMC Journal. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.07882</p></details> |
| **[Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interior Point Method for AC and DC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19146v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method (L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the criticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach rather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional IPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution. However, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes increasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later steps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using only the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features about the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that enforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line flows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the IPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step, significantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for convergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load scenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions, efficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results on a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed L-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\%, while maintaining accuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and bypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of traditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations by up to 85.5\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM outperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echoes of the past: A unified perspective on fading memory and echo states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19145v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeFlow: Temporal Conditioning for Longitudinal Brain MRI Registration and Aging Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08667v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal brain analysis is essential for understanding healthy aging and identifying pathological deviations. Longitudinal registration of sequential brain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by reliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and temporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain states. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \emph{TimeFlow}, a learning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a continuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow estimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling non-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by our proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the deformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve temporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness regularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both future timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating neurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring segmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and mitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of brain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond the observed study period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Analysis of Spiking Neural Systems via Transfer Entropy and Directed Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19048v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions. We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.</p></details> |  |

Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15787v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Combined Stochastic and Robust Optimization for Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand with Nested Benders Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19933v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Efficient Human-Aware Task Allocation for Multi-Robot Systems in Shared Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19731v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in environments populated by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 4 Figures, Accepted in IROS2025</p></details> |

Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the ICIP Satellite Workshop 2025</p></details> |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes. Project page: https://becky-catherine.github.io/Style4D .

| **[SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12777v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Video-Based Robot Failure Detection Using Task Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18705v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code and annotations are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECMR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation in Echocardiography Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18681v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Timescale Learning for Pilot-Free ISAC Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17749v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A pilot-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is investigated, in which phase-modulated continuous wave (PMCW) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) waveforms are co-designed to achieve simultaneous target sensing and data transmission. To enhance effective data throughput (i.e., Goodput) in PMCW-NOMA ISAC systems, we propose a deep learning-based receiver architecture, termed two-timescale Transformer (T3former), which leverages a Transformer architecture to perform joint channel estimation and multi-user signal detection without the need for dedicated pilot signals. By treating the deterministic structure of the PMCW waveform as an implicit pilot, the proposed T3former eliminates the overhead associated with traditional pilot-based methods. The proposed T3former processes the received PMCW-NOMA signals on two distinct timescales, where a fine-grained attention mechanism captures local features across the fast-time dimension, while a coarse-grained mechanism aggregates global spatio-temporal dependencies of the slow-time dimension. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed T3former significantly outperforms traditional successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers, which avoids inherent error propagation in SIC. Specifically, the proposed T3former achieves a substantially lower bit error rate and a higher Goodput, approaching the theoretical maximum capacity of a pilot-free system.</p></details> |  |

However, their rapid proliferation has outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 pages |

We introduce spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP), a training approach that adjusts synaptic weights based on the degree of synchronous neural firing rather than spike timing order. Our method operates as a local, post-optimization mechanism that applies updates to sparse parameter subsets, maintaining computational efficiency with linear scaling. SSDP serves as a lightweight event-structure regularizer, biasing the network toward biologically plausible spatio-temporal synchrony while preserving standard convergence behavior. SSDP seamlessly integrates with standard backpropagation while preserving the forward computation graph. We validate our approach across single-layer SNNs and spiking Transformers on datasets from static images to high-temporal-resolution tasks, demonstrating improved convergence stability and enhanced robustness to spike-time jitter and event noise. These findings provide new insights into how biological neural networks might leverage synchronous activity for efficient information processing and suggest that synchrony-dependent plasticity represents a key computational principle underlying neural learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Multi-Level LVLM Guidance for Untrimmed Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17442v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer (ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions, including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3 and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mimicking the Physicist's Eye:A VLM-centric Approach for Physics Formula Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17380v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii) channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing (STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB) and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://cmlab-korea.github.io/MoCHA-former/</p></details> |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

Such time series usually arise when a longer temporal or spatio-temporal point process is sliced into smaller time units; for example, when an annual process is sliced into 365 daily replications. We assume the point processes follow a doubly-stochastic Poisson model with log-Gaussian intensity functions. The proposed autocorrelograms are computationally simple and based on binning. The asymptotic distribution of the autocorrelations is established. The ability of the method to detect the patterns of common autoregressive and moving-average time series models is shown by simulation. Two examples of application to temporal and spatial point-process time series are shown, pertaining bike demand in the Divvy bike-sharing system of Chicago and street theft in Chicago, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR (Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences" through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module, specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning, while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion. Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference speed.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

These tracking data can be used to calibrate mathematical models describing the motility of individual entities. The challenges in calibrating models for single-agent motion derive from the intrinsic characteristics of experimental data, collected at discrete time steps and with measurement noise. We consider motion of individual agents that can be described by velocity-jump models in one spatial dimension. These agents transition between a network of \textit{n} states, in which each state is associated with a fixed velocity and fixed rates of switching to every other state. Exploiting approximate solutions to the resultant stochastic process, we develop a Bayesian inference framework to calibrate these models to discrete-time noisy data. We first demonstrate that the framework can be used to effectively recover the model parameters of data simulated from two-state and three-state models. Finally, we explore the question of model selection first using simulated data and then using experimental data tracking mRNA transport inside \textit{Drosophila} neurons. Overall, our results demonstrate that the framework is effective and efficient in calibrating and selecting between velocity-jump models and it can be applied to a range of motion processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures SI: 21 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

We introduce SDS ("See it. Do it. Sorted."), an automated pipeline for skill acquisition from unstructured demonstrations. Using GPT-4o, SDS applies novel prompting techniques, in the form of spatio-temporal grid-based visual encoding ($G_{v}$) and structured input decomposition (SUS). These produce executable reward functions (RF) from the raw input videos. The RFs are used to train PPO policies and are optimized through closed-loop evolution, using training footage and performance metrics as self-supervised signals. SDS allows quadrupeds (e.g. Unitree Go1) to learn four gaits -- trot, bound, pace, and hop -- achieving 100% gait matching fidelity, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in the order of $10^{-6}$, and stable locomotion with zero failures, both in simulation and the real world. SDS generalizes to morphologically different quadrupeds (e.g. ANYmal) and outperforms prior work in data efficiency, training time and engineering effort.

| **[MMAD: Multi-label Micro-Action Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05311v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

Yet, traditional localization methods often lack cryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them vulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on Proof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance bounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable verifiable, tamper-resistant location claims. As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides a unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs. We first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic guarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models, and (4) interaction and overhead. Building on this, we introduce a methodology to map application-specific requirements onto appropriate PoL architectures. We illustrate this process through three use cases (retail e-coupons, supply chain auditing, and physical e-voting), each showing how different constraints shape protocol choices. Overall, this work offers a structured approach to building secure, scalable, and interoperable PoL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to the 29th International Conference on Enterprise Design, Operations, and Computing (EDOC 2025)</p></details> |

However, real-world videos often vary in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags, points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.</p></details> | ICCVW'25 |

Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Towards safe control parameter tuning in distributed multi-agent systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13608v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.</p></details> | Accepted to CDC 2025 |

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2025</p></details> |

Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, "Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet)," which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique is introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results are reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 10 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and user-specific historical information can help the model better understand individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is the extended version of our work accepted at the 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems</p></details> |

Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.</p></details> |  |

Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild datasets.We argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding silhouettes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures, and the results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed alignment strategy.Specifically, on the challenging Gait3D dataset, our method achieved an average performance improvement of 7.9% across all evaluated networks. Furthermore, our method achieves substantial improvements on cross-domain datasets, with accuracy improvements of up to 24.0%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synchronization and semantization in deep spiking networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12975v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown how spiking networks can learn complex functionality through error-correcting plasticity, but the resulting structures and dynamics remain poorly studied. To elucidate how these models may link to observed dynamics in vivo and thus how they may ultimately explain cortical computation, we need a better understanding of their emerging patterns. We train a multi-layer spiking network, as a conceptual analog of the bottom-up visual hierarchy, for visual input classification using spike-time encoding. After learning, we observe the development of distinct spatio-temporal activity patterns. While input patterns are synchronous by construction, activity in early layers first spreads out over time, followed by re-convergence into sharp pulses as classes are gradually extracted. The emergence of synchronicity is accompanied by the formation of increasingly distinct pathways, reflecting the gradual semantization of input activity. We thus observe hierarchical networks learning spike latency codes to naturally acquire activity patterns characterized by synchronicity and separability, with pronounced excitatory pathways ascending through the layers. This provides a rigorous computational hypothesis for the experimentally observed synchronicity in the visual system as a natural consequence of deep learning in cortex.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 4 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways.

| **[The path to a goal: Understanding soccer possessions via path signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12930v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |

However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image, causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research purposes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model for Skeleton-Based Human Action Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12586v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training. The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks, covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI, Code is available at: https://github.com/wengwanjiang/FoundSkelModel</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Rotational Calibration for Event-Centric Multi-Sensor Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12564v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras generate asynchronous signals in response to pixel-level brightness changes, offering a sensing paradigm with theoretically microsecond-scale latency that can significantly enhance the performance of multi-sensor systems. Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras remains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets. Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a continuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both publicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while exhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting its precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our implementation will be made open-source. Code: https://github.com/NAIL-HNU/EvMultiCalib.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Root Cause Analysis of Hydrogen Bond Separation in Spatio-Temporal Molecular Dynamics using Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12500v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |
| **[Fast Algorithm for Moving Sound Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03065v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural network-based speech processing systems usually need to have reverberation resistance, so the training of such systems requires a large amount of reverberation data. In the process of system training, it is now more inclined to use sampling static systems to simulate dynamic systems, or to supplement data through actually recorded data. However, this cannot fundamentally solve the problem of simulating motion data that conforms to physical laws. Aiming at the core issue of insufficient training data for speech enhancement models in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal sampling reconstruction theory to realize efficient simulation of motion continuous time-varying reverberation. This theory breaks through the limitations of the traditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems. By decomposing the impulse response of the moving image source into two parts: linear time-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay, a moving sound field model conforming to physical laws is established. Based on the band-limited characteristics of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is proposed: high sampling rate is used for low-order images to retain details, and low sampling rate is used for high-order images to reduce computational complexity. A fast synthesis architecture is designed to realize real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared with the open-source models, the proposed theory can more accurately restore the amplitude and phase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry problem of motion sound source data simulation, and providing high-quality dynamic training data for speech enhancement models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EraserDiT: Fast Video Inpainting with Diffusion Transformer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12853v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage. Additionally, the proposed method interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts. In terms of processing speed, it takes only 65 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA H800 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $2160 \times 2100$ with 97 frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture restoration, and temporal consistency.

These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.</p></details> | Accept to ACMMM 2025 |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-Disentangled spatiotemporal Modeling for Long-term Traffic Emission Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11923v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed various fairness metrics for matching algorithms, but it is often unclear how one should balance the various parties' fairness, given that they are often in conflict. We present FairVizARD, a visualization-based system that aids users in evaluating the fairness of ride-sharing matching algorithms. FairVizARD presents the algorithms' results by visualizing relevant spatio-temporal information using animation and aggregated information in charts. FairVizARD also employs efficient techniques for visualizing a large amount of information in a user friendly manner, which makes it suitable for real-world settings. We conduct our experiments on a real-world large-scale taxi dataset and, through user studies and an expert interview, we show how users can use FairVizARD not only to evaluate the fairness of matching algorithms but also to expand on their notions of fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTSM: Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling for Cross-Subject EEG Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11357v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Video Tokenization with Generative 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11183v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp., lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction, while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers comparable compression performance.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Actions to Words: Towards Abstractive-Textual Policy Summarization in RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10509v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are difficult to explain to users, as they emerge from the interaction of complex reward structures and neural network representations. Consequently, analyzing and predicting agent behavior can be challenging, undermining user trust in real-world applications. To facilitate user understanding, current methods for global policy summarization typically rely on videos that demonstrate agent behavior in a subset of world states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, constraining their understanding. Moreover, these methods place the burden of interpretation on users by presenting raw behaviors rather than synthesizing them into coherent patterns. To resolve these issues, we introduce SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using Large Language Models), advocating for a new paradigm of abstractive-textual policy explanations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)-which possess extensive world knowledge and pattern synthesis capabilities-SySLLM generates textual summaries that provide structured and comprehensible explanations of agent policies. SySLLM demonstrates that LLMs can interpret spatio-temporally structured descriptions of state-action trajectories from an RL agent and generate valuable policy insights in a zero-shot setting, without any prior knowledge or fine-tuning. Our evaluation shows that SySLLM captures key insights, such as goal preferences and exploration strategies, that were also identified by human experts. Furthermore, in a large-scale user study (with 200 participants), SySLLM summaries were preferred over demonstration-based summaries (HIGHLIGHTS) by a clear majority (75.5%) of participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames, fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations. Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method.

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information, diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore, the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs. Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective baselines while utilizing fewer frames.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |

This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSD-TS: Exploring the Potential of Linear State Space Models for Diffusion Models in Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike most existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for empirical applications even with nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. Furthermore, our method mitigates the distributional bias common among many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. We establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering both linear and nonlinear time series and an analysis on a real-world groundwater dataset, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.

Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |

However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks.

Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

Despite their strengths, they struggle with capturing high-dimensional distributions and cross-feature dependencies. Recent work explores generative approaches using diffusion or flow-based models, extending to time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability remains a challenge.

| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN.

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

The issue of uncovering interaction relations in such systems using observable dynamics is called relational inference.

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImDiffusion: Imputed Diffusion Models for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00754v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is of paramount importance for ensuring the efficient operation of large-scale systems across diverse domains. However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, which conducts projections onto every other marginal alternatingly. However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data. We show that optimizing the transport cost improves the performance and the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art result in healthcare and environmental data while exhibiting the advantage of exploring both temporal and feature patterns in probabilistic time series imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |

Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502v2)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |
| **[NRTSI: Non-Recurrent Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03340v3)** | 2021-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is a fundamental task for understanding time series with missing data. Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Data Imputation: A Survey on Deep Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11347v1)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are all around in real-world applications. However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |
| **[CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09904v2)** | 2019-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications involve multivariate, geo-tagged time series data: at each location, multiple sensors record corresponding measurements. For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world problems data has missing values, which may difficult the application of machine learning techniques to extract information. In this paper we focus on the task of imputation of time series. Many imputation methods for time series are based on regression methods. Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly when the variables are categorical. To address this case, we propose a new imputation method based on Expectation Maximization over dynamic Bayesian networks. The approach is assessed with synthetic and real data, and it outperforms several state-of-the art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master paper, draft to be submitted</p></details> |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix Information with History Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01474v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Solar Flare Prediction Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |
| **[ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03310v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures V3: Revised significantly.

We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations.

| **[Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Kernel-Based Approach for Accurate Steady-State Detection in Performance Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04204v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of accurately detecting the transition from the warmup phase to the steady state in performance metric time series, which is a critical step for effective benchmarking. The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19341v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks.

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue.

| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

| **[Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting asynchronous bioprocess timeseries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02079v2)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cultivation experiments often produce sparse and irregular time series. Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Precursor-of-Anomaly Detection for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15489v3)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is an important field that aims to identify unexpected patterns or data points, and it is closely related to many real-world problems, particularly to applications in finance, manufacturing, cyber security, and so on. While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Deep Efficient Continuous Manifold Learning for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03379v2)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling non-Euclidean data is drawing extensive attention along with the unprecedented successes of deep neural networks in diverse fields. Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUTS+: High-dimensional Causal Discovery from Irregular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05890v2)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series is a fundamental problem in the machine learning community, enabling causal reasoning and decision-making in complex scenarios. Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |
| **[Time-Parameterized Convolutional Neural Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03210v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Time Evidential Distributions for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13503v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent in many real-world settings such as healthcare, irregular time series are challenging to formulate predictions from. It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

| **[Warpformer: A Multi-scale Modeling Approach for Irregular Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09368v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in various fields, particularly in healthcare, and exhibit two key characteristics: intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |

Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |

Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Continuous Stochastic Processes with Dynamic Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10516v4)** | 2021-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution and have proved to be powerful models for data generation and density estimation. In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Convolutions: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Raw Seismic Data Ingestion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13631v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional seismic processing workflows (SPW) are expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Integration Learning for Irregularly-sampled Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09986v2)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) data is sparse and irregular as it is recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926v2)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Model for Demand and Supply Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12469v1)** | 2020-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for demand forecasting only focus on modeling the temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Discrete-Guided Diffusion for Scalable and Safe Multi-Robot Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace. While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models. The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and (3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Conditional Simulation for Complex Spatial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20067v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key objective in spatial statistics is to simulate from the distribution of a spatial process at a selection of unobserved locations conditional on observations (i.e., a predictive distribution) to enable spatial prediction and uncertainty quantification. However, exact conditional simulation from this predictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process models. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a general method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural diffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional score-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a predictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and spatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural network that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for training. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the observations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those observations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to conditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without retraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against simulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model, and against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick process model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more efficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC techniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables efficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive distributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.</p></details> | 59 pages, 11 figures |
| **[GS: Generative Segmentation via Label Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20020v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise, conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description. This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Solving Inverse Problems using Diffusion with Iterative Colored Renoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17468v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models, but doing so requires approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the diffusion reverse process. We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

| **[EEGDM: EEG Representation Learning via Generative Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14086v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the model using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EEGDM...</summary><p>EEGDM Preprint 10 Pages</p></details> |

Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |
| **[The Information Dynamics of Generative Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19897v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</p></details> |  |

However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions. Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/binjiezhang/Ego-PM (branch: main)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Diagnostic Quality Flat-Panel Detector CT Imaging Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16252v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts. However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT. This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans. Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableIntrinsic: Detail-preserving One-step Diffusion Model for Multi-view Material Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19789v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering material information from images has been extensively studied in computer graphics and vision. Recent works in material estimation leverage diffusion model showing promising results. However, these diffusion-based methods adopt a multi-step denoising strategy, which is time-consuming for each estimation. Such stochastic inference also conflicts with the deterministic material estimation task, leading to a high variance estimated results. In this paper, we introduce StableIntrinsic, a one-step diffusion model for multi-view material estimation that can produce high-quality material parameters with low variance. To address the overly-smoothing problem in one-step diffusion, StableIntrinsic applies losses in pixel space, with each loss designed based on the properties of the material. Additionally, StableIntrinsic introduces a Detail Injection Network (DIN) to eliminate the detail loss caused by VAE encoding, while further enhancing the sharpness of material prediction results. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art techniques by achieving a $9.9\%$ improvement in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of albedo, and by reducing the Mean Square Error (MSE) for metallic and roughness by $44.4\%$ and $60.0\%$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized MR-Informed Diffusion Models for 3D PET Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03804v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images. With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative deep learning or large training datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Fast 3D Diffusion for Scalable Granular Media Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19752v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating granular media, using Discrete Element Method is a computationally intensive task. This is especially true during initialization phase, which dominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and associated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative pipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily large granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic configurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling task, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to generate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D inpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs, stitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples with physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several masking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the network to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised tensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a 2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground truth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted losses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both models are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from small-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time with respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20 seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain geometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent, real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Image Detection via Spectral Gaps of QC-RBIM Nishimori Bethe-Hessian Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19698v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired, model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature, producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features, an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical, unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures. Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly detection.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

These models are often trained on numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on average across four tasks compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)</p></details> |

Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15579v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |
| **[IELDG: Suppressing Domain-Specific Noise with Inverse Evolution Layers for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19604v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model using labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust generalization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to improve generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data generated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often contain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training segmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation and error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse evolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using Laplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable generative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced diffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality images. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs can also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation. Based on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and propose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain scenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across scales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module, which performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of multi-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Noisy Label Conditional Diffusion Models with Score-based Discriminator Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19581v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained prominence as state-of-the-art techniques for synthesizing images and videos, particularly due to their ability to scale effectively with large datasets. Recent studies have uncovered that these extensive datasets often contain mistakes from manual labeling processes. However, the extent to which such errors compromise the generative capabilities and controllability of diffusion models is not well studied. This paper introduces Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC), a guidance technique for aligning noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models. The guidance is built on discriminator training using adversarial loss, drawing on prior noise detection techniques to assess the authenticity of each sample. We further show that limiting the usage of our guidance to the early phase of the generation process leads to better performance. Our method is computationally efficient, only marginally increases inference time, and does not require retraining diffusion models. Experiments on different noise settings demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p></details> |  |

While recent text-driven methods have made significant strides, they often struggle with achieving precise alignment between linguistic descriptions and motion semantics, as well as with the inefficiencies of slow, multi-step inference. To address these issues, we introduce TMR++ Aligned Preference Optimization (TAPO), an innovative framework that aligns subtle motion variations with textual modifiers and incorporates iterative adjustments to reinforce semantic grounding. To further enable real-time synthesis, we propose MotionFLUX, a high-speed generation framework based on deterministic rectified flow matching. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which require hundreds of denoising steps, MotionFLUX constructs optimal transport paths between noise distributions and motion spaces, facilitating real-time synthesis. The linearized probability paths reduce the need for multi-step sampling typical of sequential methods, significantly accelerating inference time without sacrificing motion quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, together, TAPO and MotionFLUX form a unified system that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality, while also accelerating generation speed. The code and pretrained models will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[To the Noise and Back: Diffusion for Shared Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12244v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared autonomy is an operational concept in which a user and an autonomous agent collaboratively control a robotic system. It provides a number of advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many settings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the environment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or knowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many domains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete or constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward specification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that necessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in contrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it require access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework learns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a diffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this distribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process in a manner that preserves the user's control authority. We evaluate our framework on a series of challenging continuous control tasks, and analyze its ability to effectively correct user actions while maintaining their autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusion-for-shared-autonomy.github.io/</p></details> |

The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees. Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for scalable agricultural digital twin systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Control for Fine-tuning Diffusion Models: Optimality, Regularity, and Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18164v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations, and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed PI-FT algorithm through numerical experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinbinhan/fine-tuning-of-diffusion-models.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Realizing AmI at global scale requires sixth generation (6G) wireless networks with capabilities for real time perception, reasoning, and action aligned with human behavior and mobility patterns. We argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is the creative core of such environments. Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can generate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps, including generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas, translating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future network conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without compromising privacy. This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and generative transformers, and connects them to practical AmI use cases, including spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency communication, intelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G enablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate distributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on device training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and AmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition, but a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an ambient intelligent ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as a chapter to the book Ambient Intelligence for 6G</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Diffusion Annealing-Based Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Motivated by this challenge, this work introduces three benchmark problems for evaluating the performance of diffusion model based samplers. The benchmark problems, which are inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval, have a posterior density that is analytically known. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of posterior sampling algorithms. This work also introduces a general framework for diffusion model based posterior sampling, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA). This framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion-model-based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. We tested the performance of a set of BIPSDA algorithms, including previously proposed state-of-the-art approaches, on the proposed benchmark problems. The results provide insight into the strengths and limitations of existing diffusion-model based posterior samplers, while the benchmark problems provide a testing ground for future algorithmic developments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Surjectivity of Neural Networks: Can you elicit any behavior from your model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19445v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Generating Multidimensional Calorimeter Data with Tensor Decomposition Parameterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19443v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing large complex simulation datasets can often be a time and resource consuming task. Especially when these experiments are very expensive, it is becoming more reasonable to generate synthetic data for downstream tasks. Recently, these methods may include using generative machine learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. As these generative models improve efficiency in producing useful data, we introduce an internal tensor decomposition to these generative models to even further reduce costs. More specifically, for multidimensional data, or tensors, we generate the smaller tensor factors instead of the full tensor, in order to significantly reduce the model's output and overall parameters. This reduces the costs of generating complex simulation data, and our experiments show the generated data remains useful. As a result, tensor decomposition has the potential to improve efficiency in generative models, especially when generating multidimensional data, or tensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Sample Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning through the Integration of Diffusion Models and Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01427v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO are attractive for continuous control but suffer from poor sample efficiency in costly, high dimensional settings. We present a strictly on policy framework that treats a conditional diffusion model as an adaptable action prior rather than a policy or world model. The prior is pre trained on logged data and used online only at sampling time to propose actions at current on policy states. Two lightweight mechanisms - value guided proposal generation (energy re weighting and in process gradient guidance) and a soft prior KL - regularize the actor via a small auxiliary imitation loss while keeping all PPO updates strictly on on-policy rollouts. To adapt the prior without heavy compute, we apply parameter efficient tuning (PET) that updates only adapters/LoRA, yielding a dual proximal view: policy KL is constrained by PPO and prior KL by PET. Across eight MuJoCo tasks under a shared 1.0M step budget, our method improves early learning (ALC@40) in 3/4 settings and matches or exceeds final return on 6/8 tasks with only 15-30% wall clock overhead. Ablations show that freezing the prior degrades performance and removing value guidance slows early learning; t SNE analyses confirm that value guidance concentrates proposals in high Q regions. Results indicate that an adaptable diffusion action prior is a practical way to boost on policy PPO under tight interaction budgets.</p></details> |  |

Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://light.princeton.edu/LSD-3D</p></details> |
| **[All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces. Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules. However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes. Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at: https://github.com/ywxsuperstar/KSAE-FaceSteer.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data. While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p></details> |  |

We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p></details> | 55 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Generative Data Augmentation for Object Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17783v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align.</p></details> |  |

However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ForgetMe: Evaluating Selective Forgetting in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12574v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world data acquisition requires extensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles, specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.</p></details> |  |

It has crucial biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to \textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying SemCom over digital systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions, achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) scores.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models (Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation (reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii) dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence, component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics, and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.</p></details> |  |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of data concerning spatial relationships in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We propose CoMPaSS, a versatile framework that enhances spatial understanding in T2I models. It first addresses data ambiguity with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data via principled constraints. To leverage these priors, CoMPaSS also introduces the Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module, which preserves crucial token ordering information lost by text encoders, thereby reinforcing the prompt's linguistic structure. Extensive experiments on four popular T2I models (UNet and MMDiT-based) show CoMPaSS sets a new state of the art on key spatial benchmarks, with substantial relative gains on VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)).

| **[Follow My Hold: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction through Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18213v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aidilayce.github.io/FollowMyHold-page/</p></details> |
| **[Incorporating Pre-trained Diffusion Models in Solving the SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18095v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM), Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future research on generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weather-robust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

In this work we explore the use of diffusion models for dysarthric speech enhancement, which is based on the hypothesis that using diffusion-based speech enhancement moves the distribution of dysarthric speech closer to that of typical speech, which could potentially improve dysarthric speech recognition performance. We assess the effect of two diffusion-based and one signal-processing-based speech enhancement algorithms on intelligibility and speech quality of two English dysarthric speech corpora. We applied speech enhancement to both typical and dysarthric speech and evaluate the ASR performance using Whisper-Turbo, and the subjective and objective speech quality of the original and enhanced dysarthric speech. We also fine-tuned Whisper-Turbo on the enhanced speech to assess its impact on recognition performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025.

We propose DiffAug a novel framework that combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVAMD Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEIDM: A Controlled Entity and Interaction Diffusion Model for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17760v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their interaction control.</p></details> |  |

However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recovery-based Black-Box Detection of AI-Generated Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01008v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proliferation of photorealistic images created by generative models has sparked both excitement and concern, as these images are increasingly indistinguishable from real ones to the human eye. While offering new creative and commercial possibilities, the potential for misuse, such as in misinformation and fraud, highlights the need for effective detection methods. Current detection approaches often rely on access to model weights or require extensive collections of real image datasets, limiting their scalability and practical application in real world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel black box detection framework that requires only API access, sidestepping the need for model weights or large auxiliary datasets. Our approach leverages a corrupt and recover strategy: by masking part of an image and assessing the model ability to reconstruct it, we measure the likelihood that the image was generated by the model itself. For black-box models that do not support masked image inputs, we incorporate a cost efficient surrogate model trained to align with the target model distribution, enhancing detection capability. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across eight diffusion model variant datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

Despite these advances, current methods still suffer from a critical problem: attribute leakage, where edits meant for specific objects unintentionally affect unrelated regions or other target objects. Our analysis reveals the root cause as the semantic entanglement inherent in End-of-Sequence (EOS) embeddings generated by autoregressive text encoders, which indiscriminately aggregate attributes across prompts. To address this issue, we introduce Attribute-Leakage-free Editing (ALE), a framework that tackles attribute leakage at its source. ALE combines Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to disentangle text embeddings, Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) for spatially precise attention, and Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited content. To quantitatively evaluate attribute leakage across various editing methods, we propose the Attribute-Leakage Evaluation Benchmark (ALE-Bench), featuring comprehensive editing scenarios and new metrics. Extensive experiments show that ALE reduces attribute leakage by large margins, thereby enabling accurate, multi-object, text-driven image editing while faithfully preserving non-target content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.</p></details> | 17 figures |

Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI CAPI 2025</p></details> |

However, the impact of lighting is deeply coupled with other factors of videos, e.g., objects and scenes. Thus, it remains challenging to disentangle and model coherent lighting conditions independently, limiting the flexibility to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models. LumiSculpt equips the video generation with new interactive capabilities, allowing the input of reference image sequences with customized lighting conditions. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates direct control over the intensity, position and trajectory of an assumed light source in video diffusion models. To effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation. The analysis demonstrates the flexibility of LumiHuman.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Edge of Memorization in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17689v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model (under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical investigations.

Its potential in healthcare is significant, but challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data, exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues. CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation. The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution differences across clients without compromising privacy.</p></details> | Need improvement |

However, security and privacy concerns restrict access to real-world data, making statistically accurate and physically consistent synthetic datasets a viable alternative. We develop a diffusion model for generating synthetic power flow datasets from real-world power grids that both replicate the statistical properties of the real-world data and ensure AC power flow feasibility. To enforce the constraints, we incorporate gradient guidance based on the power flow constraints to steer diffusion sampling toward feasible samples. For computational efficiency, we further leverage insights from the fast decoupled power flow method and propose a variable decoupling strategy for the training and sampling of the diffusion model. These solutions lead to a physics-informed diffusion model, generating power flow datasets that outperform those from the standard diffusion in terms of feasibility and statistical similarity, as shown in experiments across IEEE benchmark systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is the extended journal version of our paper at ICML 2025 Workshop "DataWorld: Unifying Data Curation Frameworks Across Domains"</p></details> |

While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon, wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion acceleration methods.</p></details> | 12 pages in total |

The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired "target" concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts. In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present several side effects of concept erasure. For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side Effect Evaluation (SEE), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes. This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage. Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal. We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel prompt-guided reflection removal (PromptRR) framework that uses frequency information as new visual prompts for better reflection performance. Specifically, the proposed framework decouples the reflection removal process into the prompt generation and subsequent prompt-guided restoration. For the prompt generation, we first propose a prompt pre-training strategy to train a frequency prompt encoder that encodes the ground-truth image into LF and HF prompts. Then, we adopt diffusion models (DMs) as prompt generators to generate the LF and HF prompts estimated by the pre-trained frequency prompt encoder. For the prompt-guided restoration, we integrate specially generated prompts into the PromptFormer network, employing a novel Transformer-based prompt block to effectively steer the model toward enhanced reflection removal.

| **[Variational Shape Inference for Grasp Diffusion on SE(3)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17482v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge, we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[TinySR: Pruning Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17434v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR, a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv. We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high quality results.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  |

This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Shortlisting Model (SLM), a novel simplex-based diffusion model inspired by progressive candidate pruning. SLM operates on simplex centroids, reducing generation complexity and enhancing scalability. Additionally, SLM incorporates a flexible implementation of classifier-free guidance, enhancing unconditional generation performance. Extensive experiments on DNA promoter and enhancer design, protein design, character-level and large-vocabulary language modeling demonstrate the competitive performance and strong potential of SLM.

| **[Image Augmentation Agent for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20439v4)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Neurocomputing 2025</p></details> |

As generative models continue to scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation, highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising, positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its practical value and potential for broad adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundDiff: Foundational Diffusion Model for Generalizable Low-Dose CT Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17299v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB) based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels.

However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

| **[Expert-Guided Diffusion Planner for Auto-Bidding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08687v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-bidding is widely used in advertising systems, serving a diverse range of advertisers. Generative bidding is increasingly gaining traction due to its strong planning capabilities and generalizability. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not depend on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), thereby exhibiting superior planning performance in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling approaches have shown significant promise in the field of auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality criterion is insufficient to guarantee the generation of truly optimal decision sequences, as it lacks personalized structural information. Moreover, the auto-regressive generation mechanism of diffusion models inherently introduces timeliness risks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion modeling approach that integrates expert trajectory guidance with a skip-step sampling strategy to improve generation efficiency. The efficacy of this method has been demonstrated through comprehensive offline experiments and further substantiated by statistically significant outcomes in online A/B testing, yielding an 11.29% increase in conversions and a 12.36% growth in revenue relative to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the CIKM 2025 Applied Research Track, eight (8) pages, three (3) figures</p></details> |
| **[4D Visual Pre-training for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17230v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

This unified approach is more efficient and coherent than current pipelines that use separate models for appearance and geometry. Orchid is versatile - it directly generates color, depth, and normal images from text, supports joint monocular depth and normal estimation with color-conditioned finetuning, and seamlessly inpaints large 3D regions by sampling from the joint distribution. It leverages a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that jointly encodes RGB, relative depth, and surface normals into a shared latent space, combined with a latent diffusion model that denoises these latents. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Orchid delivers competitive performance against SOTA task-specific methods for geometry prediction, even surpassing them in normal-prediction accuracy and depth-normal consistency. It also inpaints color-depth-normal images jointly, with more qualitative realism than existing multi-step methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 main conference, 8 pages paper, 20 pages appendix, 24 figures, supplementary pseudocode in appendix, https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/1176</p></details> |
| **[Dual Orthogonal Guidance for Robust Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17017v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales, DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and challenging writing styles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Watermarking Visual Concepts for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v3)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating images with specific concepts. This ability also poses great threats to copyright protection and network security since malicious users can generate unauthorized content and disinformation relevant to a target concept. Model watermarking is an effective solution to trace the malicious generated images and safeguard their copyright. However, existing model watermarking techniques merely achieve image-level tracing without concept traceability. When tracing infringing or harmful concepts, current approaches execute image concept detection and model tracing sequentially, where performance is critically constrained by concept detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight concept watermarking framework that efficiently binds target concepts to model watermarks, supporting simultaneous concept identification and model tracing via single-stage watermark verification. To further enhance the robustness of concept watermarking, we propose an adversarial perturbation injection method collaboratively embedded with watermarks during image generation, avoiding watermark removal by model purification attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptWM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods, improving detection accuracy by 6.3%-19.3% across diverse datasets including COCO and StableDiffusionDB. Additionally, ConceptWM possesses a critical capability absent in other watermarking methods: it sustains a 21.7% FID/CLIP degradation under adversarial fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models on WikiArt and CelebA-HQ, demonstrating its capability to mitigate model misuse.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of predicted noisy samples in the reverse process continuously declines compared to perturbed samples in the forward process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) The subband energy of reverse-process reconstructed samples is consistently lower than that of forward-process ones, and both are lower than the original data samples. Based on the first finding, we introduce a dynamic frequency regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we derive the rigorous mathematical form of exposure bias. It is worth noting that, our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and frameworks with negligible computational cost.

To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000 halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.</p></details> |  |

While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in SBGs. Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs. In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization; (ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and (iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

| **[Parameter-Free Structural-Diversity Message Passing for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19884v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the full implementation of SDGNN has been released at: https://github.com/mingyue15694/SGDNN/tree/main</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |

From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$. To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP. It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and (\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond $[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various baselines. We have made our code public at https://github.com/KuroginQin/InfraredGP</p></details> |  |

Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the ICIP Satellite Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Efficiency of Sampling-based Motion Planning via Message-Passing Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03909v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based motion planning methods, while effective in high-dimensional spaces, often suffer from inefficiencies due to irregular sampling distributions, leading to suboptimal exploration of the configuration space. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space, with uniformity assessed using the the $\cL_p$-discrepancy measure, which quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques in terms of planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Graph Attention Network: A Novel Quantum Multi-Head Attention Mechanism for Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17630v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Topology Optimization for Self-Supporting Structures in Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19169v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for topology optimization of self-supporting structures, specifically tailored for additive manufacturing (AM). By employing a graph neural network (GNN) that acts as a neural field over the finite element mesh, the framework effectively learns and predicts continuous material distributions. An integrated AM filter ensures printability by eliminating unsupported overhangs, while the optimization process minimizes structural compliance under volume and stress constraints. The stress constraint is enforced using a differentiable p-norm aggregation of von Mises stress, promoting mechanical reliability in the optimized designs. A key advantage of the approach lies in its fully differentiable architecture, which leverages automatic differentiation throughout the optimization loop--eliminating the need for explicit sensitivity derivation for both the filter and the stress constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate stress-constrained manufacturable topologies under various loading and boundary conditions, offering a practical pathway toward AM-ready high-performance designs with reduced post-processing requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Triangulation-Based Graph Rewiring for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19071v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset. Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to 97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20 vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization, Expressivity, and Universality of Graph Neural Networks on Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05464v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

Based on extensions of standard results in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals (rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking, which is more sample-efficient. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baseline (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 1 figure.

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.</p></details> |  |

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
