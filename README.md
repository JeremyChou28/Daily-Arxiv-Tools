| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v5)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |
| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |
| **[Drought forecasting using a hybrid neural architecture for integrating time series and static data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05957v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable forecasting is critical for early warning systems and adaptive drought management. Most previous deep learning approaches focus solely on homogeneous regions and rely on single-structured data. This paper presents a hybrid neural architecture that integrates time series and static data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the DroughtED dataset. Our results illustrate the potential of designing neural models for the treatment of heterogeneous data in climate related tasks and present reliable prediction of USDM categories, an expert-informed drought metric. Furthermore, this work validates the potential of DroughtED for enabling location-agnostic training of deep learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, published as a workshop paper at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning at ICLR 2025, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning is a non-archival workshop</p></details> |
| **[PFML: Self-Supervised Learning of Time-Series Data Without Representation Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10087v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[StayLTC: A Cost-Effective Multimodal Framework for Hospital Length of Stay Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05691v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of Length of Stay (LOS) in hospitals is crucial for improving healthcare services, resource management, and cost efficiency. This paper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to forecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs). LTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against traditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, demonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series models, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS prediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring significantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |
| **[STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze-Guided Learning: Avoiding Shortcut Bias in Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05583v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by human visual attention, deep neural networks have widely adopted attention mechanisms to learn locally discriminative attributes for challenging visual classification tasks. However, existing approaches primarily emphasize the representation of such features while neglecting their precise localization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases. This limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on transfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of leveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained attributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and high-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Gaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence gaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention on distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through cross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with machine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate localization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues significantly enhance classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, URL: https://szyyjl.github.io/eye_tracking_data.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16379v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting solar panel power output is crucial for advancing the transition to renewable energy but is complicated by the variable and non-linear nature of solar energy. This is influenced by numerous meteorological factors, geographical positioning, and photovoltaic cell properties, posing significant challenges to forecasting accuracy and grid stability. Our study introduces a suite of solutions centered around hybrid quantum neural networks designed to tackle these complexities. The first proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory, surpasses all tested models by achieving mean absolute errors and mean squared errors that are more than 40% lower. The second proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence neural network, once trained, predicts photovoltaic power with 16% lower mean absolute error for arbitrary time intervals without the need for prior meteorological data, highlighting its versatility. Moreover, our hybrid models perform better even when trained on limited datasets, underlining their potential utility in data-scarce scenarios. These findings represent progress towards resolving time series prediction challenges in energy forecasting through hybrid quantum models, showcasing the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in catalyzing the renewable energy transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Geometry for the classification of brain states with intracortical brain-computer interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05534v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the application of Riemannian geometry-based methods for brain decoding using invasive electrophysiological recordings. Although previously employed in non-invasive, the utility of Riemannian geometry for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Here, we propose a Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, we evaluated the performance of our approach against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. Our results indicate that the Riemannian geometry-based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro-averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state-dependent organization that traditional time series-based methods often fail to capture. Our findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry-based methods and extending their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain computer interface applications.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Debiasing Continuous-time Nonlinear Autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05525v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to identify a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems defined by an ordinary differential equation affine in the unknown parameter. We define a notion of asymptotic consistency as $(n, h) \to (\infty, 0)$, and we achieve it using a family of direct methods where the first step is differentiating a noisy time series and the second step is a plug-in linear estimator. The first step, differentiation, is a signal processing adaptation of the nonparametric statistical technique of local polynomial regression. The second step, generalized linear regression, can be consistent using a least squares estimator, but we demonstrate two novel bias corrections that improve the accuracy for finite $h$. These methods significantly broaden the class of continuous-time systems that can be consistently estimated by direct methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregating time-series and image data: functors and double functors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05274v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregation of time-series or image data over subsets of the domain is a fundamental task in data science. We show that many known aggregation operations can be interpreted as (double) functors on appropriate (double) categories. Such functorial aggregations are amenable to parallel implementation via straightforward extensions of Blelloch's parallel scan algorithm. In addition to providing a unified viewpoint on existing operations, it allows us to propose new aggregation operations for time-series and image data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping biodiversity at very-high resolution in Europe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05231v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Extraction for Time Series with ECLAD-ts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05024v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for time series classification (TSC) are being increasingly used in applications ranging from quality prediction to medical diagnosis. The black box nature of these models makes understanding their prediction process difficult. This issue is crucial because CNNs are prone to learning shortcuts and biases, compromising their robustness and alignment with human expectations. To assess whether such mechanisms are being used and the associated risk, it is essential to provide model explanations that reflect the inner workings of the model. Concept Extraction (CE) methods offer such explanations, but have mostly been developed for the image domain so far, leaving a gap in the time series domain. In this work, we present a CE and localization method tailored to the time series domain, based on the ideas of CE methods for images. We propose the novel method ECLAD-ts, which provides post-hoc global explanations based on how the models encode subsets of the input at different levels of abstraction. For this, concepts are produced by clustering timestep-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps, and their importance is computed based on their impact on the prediction process. We evaluate our method on synthetic and natural datasets. Furthermore, we assess the advantages and limitations of CE in time series through empirical results. Our results show that ECLAD-ts effectively explains models by leveraging their internal representations, providing useful insights about their prediction process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Policy: Imitation Policy Learning in Frequency Domain with Wavelet Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04991v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction tasks, directly map robotic observations-such as high-dimensional visual data and proprioception-into the action space. While time series prediction primarily relies on spatial domain modeling, the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction may lead to neglecting the inherent temporal information embedded within action sequences. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of the frequency domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features from the frequency domain using the SE2MD (Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the frequency domain and increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Frequency-Domain Filter (LFDF) after each frequency decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods by over 10% on four challenging robotic arm tasks, while maintaining a comparable parameter count. In long-range settings, its performance declines more slowly as task volume increases. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13868v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series frequently manifest distribution shifts, diverse latent features, and non-stationary learning dynamics, particularly in open and evolving environments. These characteristics pose significant challenges for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While substantial progress has been made, a systematic synthesis of advancements remains lacking. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive review of OOD generalization methodologies for time series, organized to delineate the field's evolutionary trajectory and contemporary research landscape. We organize our analysis across three foundational dimensions: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For each dimension, we present several popular algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we highlight key application scenarios, emphasizing their real-world impact. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and propose future research directions. A detailed summary of the methods reviewed for the generalization of OOD in time series can be accessed at https://tsood-generalization.com.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic spectral co-clustering of directed networks to unveil latent community paths in VAR-type models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10849v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying network Granger causality in large vector autoregressive (VAR) models enhances explanatory power by capturing complex interdependencies among variables. Instead of constructing network structures solely through sparse estimation of coefficients, we explore latent community structures to uncover the underlying network dynamics. We propose a dynamic network framework that embeds directed connectivity within the transition matrices of VAR-type models, enabling tracking of evolving community structures over time. To incorporate network directionality, we employ degree-corrected stochastic co-block models for each season or cycle, integrating spectral co-clustering with singular vector smoothing to refine latent community transitions. For greater model parsimony, we adopt periodic VAR (PVAR) and vector heterogeneous autoregressive (VHAR) models as alternatives to high-lag VAR models. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness through applications to the cyclic evolution of US nonfarm payroll employment and the temporal progression of realized stock market volatilities. Indeed, spectral co-clustering of directed networks reveals dynamic latent community trajectories, offering deeper insights into the evolving structure of high-dimensional time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interval-Valued Time Series Classification Using $D_K$-Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04667v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, modeling and analysis of interval-valued time series have garnered increasing attention in econometrics, finance, and statistics. However, these studies have predominantly focused on statistical inference in the forecasting of univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series, overlooking another important aspect: classification. In this paper, we introduce a classification approach that treats intervals as unified entities, applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. Specifically, we first extend the point-valued time series imaging methods to interval-valued scenarios using the $D_K$-distance, enabling the imaging of interval-valued time series. Then, we employ suitable deep learning model for classification on the obtained imaging dataset, aiming to achieve classification for interval-valued time series. In theory, we derived a sharper excess risk bound for deep multiclassifiers based on offset Rademacher complexity. Finally, we validate the superiority of the proposed method through comparisons with various existing point-valued time series classification methods in both simulation studies and real data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Prediction of Peaks Over a Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04602v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applied fields, the prediction of more severe events than those already recorded is crucial for safeguarding against potential future calamities. What-if analyses, which evaluate hypothetical scenarios up to the worst-case event, play a key role in assessing the potential impacts of extreme events and guiding the development of effective safety policies. This problem can be analyzed using extreme value theory. We employ the well-established peaks-over-threshold method and describe a comprehensive toolkit to address forecasting needs. We examine an \lq\lq out-of-sample" variable and focus on its conditional probability of exceeding a high threshold, representing the predictive distribution of future extreme peaks. We demonstrate that the generalized Pareto approximation of the corresponding predictive density can be remarkably accurate. We then introduce frequentist methods and a Bayesian approach for estimating this predictive density, enabling the derivation of informative predictive intervals. By leveraging threshold stability, we illustrate how predictions can be reliably extended deep into the tail of the unknown data distribution. We establish the asymptotic accuracy of the proposed estimators and, more importantly, prove that the resulting predictive inference is asymptotically valid. Forecasters satisfying the tail-equivalence property allow to recover widely used risk measures for risk assessment through point forecasts. This insight lays the groundwork for a new perspective that integrates risk assessment into the statistical predictive toolbox. Finally, we extend the prediction framework to the case of linear time series. We apply the proposed predictive tools to two real-world datasets: summer peak temperatures recorded in Milan, Italy, over the past 30 years, and daily negative log-returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average observed over 30 years.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structuring Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs with Particle Swarm Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05347v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing (RC) is a time-efficient computational paradigm derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.</p></details> |  |

| **[iADCPS: Time Series Anomaly Detection for Evolving Cyber-physical Systems via Incremental Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04374v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection for cyber-physical systems (ADCPS) is crucial in identifying faults and potential attacks by analyzing the time series of sensor measurements and actuator states. However, current methods lack adaptation to data distribution shifts in both temporal and spatial dimensions as cyber-physical systems evolve. To tackle this issue, we propose an incremental meta-learning-based approach, namely iADCPS, which can continuously update the model through limited evolving normal samples to reconcile the distribution gap between evolving and historical time series. Specifically, We first introduce a temporal mixup strategy to align data for data-level generalization which is then combined with the one-class meta-learning approach for model-level generalization. Furthermore, we develop a non-parametric dynamic threshold to adaptively adjust the threshold based on the probability density of the abnormal scores without any anomaly supervision. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the iADCPS using three publicly available datasets PUMP, SWaT, and WADI. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 99.0%, 93.1%, and 78.7% F1-Score, respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ADCPS method, especially in the context of the evolving CPSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474v4)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[CATS: Mitigating Correlation Shift for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04283v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) leverages labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Given the prevalence of multivariate time series (MTS) data across various domains, the UDA task for MTS classification has emerged as a critical challenge. However, for MTS data, correlations between variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works for MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel domain shift, {\em correlation shift}, measuring domain differences in multivariate correlation. To mitigate correlation shift, we propose a scalable and parameter-efficient \underline{C}orrelation \underline{A}dapter for M\underline{TS} (CATS). Designed as a plug-and-play technique compatible with various Transformer variants, CATS employs temporal convolution to capture local temporal patterns and a graph attention module to model the changing multivariate correlation. The adapter reweights the target correlations to align the source correlations with a theoretically guaranteed precision. A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate correlation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature of MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that (1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\%$ average accuracy while only adding around $1\%$ parameters, and (2) all Transformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loss Functions in Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04242v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss functions are at the heart of deep learning, shaping how models learn and perform across diverse tasks. They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GG-SSMs: Graph-Generating State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12423v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data in computer vision and time series analysis domains. However, traditional SSMs are limited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their ability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods like Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies, they rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex dependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing graphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust feature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently modeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets, including event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow estimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant margins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet, outperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and improving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships significantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a versatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures, CVPR 2025 Camera Ready paper</p></details> |
| **[Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLM Capabilities in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03747v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p></details> | no comment |
| **[Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05336v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Time Series: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04011v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based foundation models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in time series analysis, offering unprecedented capabilities in tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, trend analysis and many more time series analytical tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

We systematically reviewed papers published between 2005--2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect study results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis reveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to different conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We replicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk. Our findings show that four papers produced significantly different results than the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn with a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack Overflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting cross-sectional research conclusions.</p></details> |  |

High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures, 32 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p></details> |  |

We highlight key design considerations for an analysis, including treatment and control group selection, timing of policy adoption, expected effect heterogeneity, and data considerations. We then provide an overview of analytic approaches and differentiate between methods based on evaluation context, such as settings with no control units, a single treated unit, multiple treated units, or with multiple treatment cohorts. Methods discussed include interrupted time series models, difference-in-differences estimators, autoregressive models, and synthetic control methods, along with method extensions which address issues like staggered policy adoption and heterogenous treatment effects. We end with an illustrative example, applying the developed framework to evaluate the impacts of state-level naloxone standing order policies on overdose rates. Overall, we provide researchers with an approach for deciding on methods for state policy evaluations, which can be used to select study designs and inform methodological choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03583v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Robustness: A Benchmarking Framework for Deep Learning Forecasting in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03494v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in domains such as manufacturing and energy distribution generate complex time series data crucial for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifiability of VAR(1) model in a stationary setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03466v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a classical First-order Vector AutoRegressive (VAR(1)) model, where we interpret the autoregressive interaction matrix as influence relationships among the components of the VAR(1) process that can be encoded by a weighted directed graph. A majority of previous work studies the structural identifiability of the graph based on time series observations and therefore relies on dynamical information. In this work we assume that an equilibrium exists, and study instead the identifiability of the graph from the stationary distribution, meaning that we seek a way to reconstruct the influence graph underlying the dynamic network using only static information. We use an approach from algebraic statistics that characterizes models using the Jacobian matroids associated with the parametrization of the models, and we introduce sufficient graphical conditions under which different graphs yield distinct steady-state distributions. Additionally, we illustrate how our results could be applied to characterize networks inspired by ecological research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

However, the field faces challenges such as limited large-scale datasets and high data acquisition costs, which hinder the development of robust algorithms. Data augmentation techniques show promise in addressing these issues, but their application to biomechanical time-series data requires comprehensive evaluation. This scoping review investigates data augmentation methods for time-series data in the biomechanics domain. It analyzes current approaches for augmenting and generating time-series datasets, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers recommendations for applying these techniques in biomechanics. Four databases, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a two-stage screening identified 21 relevant publications. Results show that there is no universally preferred method for augmenting biomechanical time-series data; instead, methods vary based on study objectives. A major issue identified is the absence of soft tissue artifacts in synthetic data, leading to discrepancies referred to as the synthetic gap. Moreover, many studies lack proper evaluation of augmentation methods, making it difficult to assess their effects on model performance and data quality. This review highlights the critical role of data augmentation in addressing limited dataset availability and improving model generalization in biomechanics. Tailoring augmentation strategies to the characteristics of biomechanical data is essential for advancing predictive modeling. A better understanding of how different augmentation methods impact data quality and downstream tasks will be key to developing more effective and realistic techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at PLOS ONE</p></details> |

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no efforts to model large-scale ITS. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction procedure for large-scale ITS, which involves key steps such as auto-segmentation and clustering, and feature transfer learning. This procedure can be seamlessly integrated with any suitable prediction models for forecasting purposes. Specifically, we transform the automatic segmentation and clustering of ITS into the estimation of Toeplitz sparse precision matrices and assignment set. The majorization-minimization algorithm is employed to convert this highly non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems. We derive efficient dynamic programming and alternating direction method to solve these two subproblems alternately and establish their convergence properties. By employing the Joint Recurrence Plot (JRP) to image subsequence and assigning a class label to each cluster, an image dataset is constructed. Then, an appropriate neural network is chosen to train on this image dataset and used to extract features for the next step of forecasting. Real data applications demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively obtain invariant representations of the raw data and enhance forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing literature primarily focuses on regression tasks while neglecting classification aspects. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach for interval-valued time series classification. Specifically, we represent interval-valued time series using convex combinations of upper and lower bounds of intervals and transform these representations into images based on point-valued time series imaging methods. We utilize a fine-grained image classification neural network to classify these images, to achieve the goal of classifying the original interval-valued time series. This proposed method is applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. On the optimization front, we treat the convex combination coefficients as learnable parameters similar to the parameters of the neural network and provide an efficient estimation method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). On the theoretical front, under specific conditions, we establish a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for generic CNNs composed of basic blocks involving convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and compare its performance against a wide range of point-valued time series classification methods.</p></details> |  |

Initially, we represent interval-valued time series using a bivariate point-valued time series, which serves as a representative form. We first transform each time series into images by employing various imaging approaches such as recurrence plot, gramian angular summation/difference field, and Markov transition field, and construct an image dataset by treating each imaging method's output as a separate class. Based on this dataset, we train several candidates for a feature extraction network (FEN), specifically ResNet with varying layers. Then we choose the penultimate layer of the FEN to extract the most relevant features from the transformed images. We integrate the extracted features into conventional predictive models to formulate the corresponding prediction models. To formulate prediction, we integrate the extracted features into a regular prediction model. The proposed methods are evaluated based on the S\&P 500 index and three data-generating processes (DGPs), and the experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement in prediction performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We use the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies among variables. This enables accurate future state predictions under varying operational conditions. To address the challenge of fluctuating anomaly scores that reduce fault severity estimation accuracy, we introduce a novel fault severity index based on the mean and standard deviation of anomaly scores. This generates a continuous and reliable severity measurement. We validate the proposed method using two experimental datasets: an open IMS bearing dataset and data collected from a fanjet electric propulsion system. Results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces abrupt fluctuations and inconsistencies in anomaly scores. This provides a more dependable foundation for maintenance planning and risk management in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

The Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm provides a valuable tool for real-time analysis of land changes, such as deforestation, urban expansion, agricultural activities, and natural disasters. This capability enables timely interventions and more informed decision-making. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the algorithm to estimate water bodies and track pixel-level water trends over time. Our findings indicate that COLD-derived data can reliably estimate estimate water frequency during stable periods and delineate water bodies. Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of trends in water areas after disturbances, allowing for the determination of whether water frequency increases, decreases, or remains constant.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we represent human mobility and the associated flow of movements as a grapyh. Graph-based approaches for mobility analysis are still in their early stages of adoption and are actively being researched. The challenges of graph-based mobility analysis are multifaceted - the lack of sufficiently high-quality data to represent flows at high spatial and teporal resolution whereas, limited computational resources to translate large voluments of mobility data into a network structure, and scaling issues inherent in graph models etc. The current study develops a methodology by embedding graphs into a continuous space, which alleviates issues related to fast graph matching, graph time-series modeling, and visualization of mobility dynamics. Through experiments, we demonstrate how mobility data collected from taxicab trajectories could be transformed into network structures and patterns of mobility flow changes, and can be used for downstream tasks reporting approx 40% decrease in error on average in matched graphs vs unmatched ones.</p></details> |  |

The estimation of the latent model parameters is based on second-order properties of the count and underlying Gaussian time series, yielding estimators of the underlying covariance matrices for which standard principal component analysis applies. Theoretical consistency results are established for the proposed estimation, building on certain concentration results for the models of the type considered. They also involve the memory of the latent Gaussian process, quantified through a spectral gap, shown to be suitably bounded as the model dimension increases, which is of independent interest. In addition, novel cross-validation schemes are suggested for model selection. The forecasting is carried out through a particle-based sequential Monte Carlo, leveraging Kalman filtering techniques. A simulation study and an application are also considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating both statistical and machine-learning-based models for RUL estimation. Our approach transforms time-series battery data into time-to-failure data using path signatures, enabling effective survival modeling. We apply five models, including Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods such as DeepHit and MTLR, to estimate failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on 362 Toyota battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The proposed methodology provides actionable insights for battery manufacturers and engineers, supporting dynamic maintenance strategies and optimized lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

This approach is pivotal in domains such as data centers, sensor networks, and finance. Traditional methods often struggle with manual parameter tuning and cannot adapt to new anomaly types. Our method overcomes these limitations by integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Active Learning. By incorporating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, our approach models sequential data and its dependencies effectively, allowing for the detection of new anomaly classes with minimal labeled data. Our innovative DRL- VAE and Active Learning combination significantly improves existing methods, as shown by our evaluations on real-world datasets, enhancing anomaly detection techniques and advancing time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A co-segmentation algorithm to predict emotional stress from passively sensed mHealth data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10558v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a data-driven co-segmentation algorithm of passively sensed and self-reported active variables collected through smartphones to identify emotionally stressful states in middle-aged and older patients with mood disorders undergoing therapy, some of whom also have chronic pain. Our method leverages the association between the different types of time series. These data are typically non-stationary, with meaningful associations often occurring only over short time windows. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, when applied globally on the entire time series, often fail to capture these time-varying local patterns. Our approach first segments the passive sensing variables by detecting their change points, then examines segment-specific associations with the active variable to identify co-segmented periods that exhibit distinct relationships between stress and passively sensed measures. We then use these periods to predict future emotional stress states using standard ML methods. By shifting the unit of analysis from individual time points to data-driven segments of time and allowing for different associations in different segments, our algorithm helps detect patterns that only exist within short-time windows. We apply our method to detect periods of stress in patient data collected during ALACRITY Phase I study. Our findings indicate that the data-driven segmentation algorithm identifies stress periods more accurately than traditional ML methods that do not incorporate segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01354v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is essential for various critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Additionally, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on the time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest five explanation spaces, each of which can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be easily integrated into existing platforms without any changes to trained models or XAI methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-To-End Self-Tuning Self-Supervised Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02865v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) finds many applications such as monitoring environmental sensors, industry KPIs, patient biomarkers, etc. A two-fold challenge for TSAD is a versatile and unsupervised model that can detect various different types of time series anomalies (spikes, discontinuities, trend shifts, etc.) without any labeled data. Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |
| **[A Dynamic, Ordinal Gaussian Process Item Response Theoretic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02643v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social scientists are often interested in using ordinal indicators to estimate latent traits that change over time. Frequently, this is done with item response theoretic (IRT) models that describe the relationship between those latent traits and observed indicators. We combine recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric IRT, which makes minimal assumptions on shapes of item response functions, and Gaussian process time series methods to capture dynamic structures in latent traits from longitudinal observations. We propose a generalized dynamic Gaussian process item response theory (GD-GPIRT) as well as a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for estimation of both latent traits and response functions. We evaluate GD-GPIRT in simulation studies against baselines in dynamic IRT, and apply it to various substantive studies, including assessing public opinions on economy environment and congressional ideology related to abortion debate.</p></details> |  |

Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Explainable and Interpretable Forecasts on Non-Smooth Multivariate Time Series for Responsible Gameplay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03777v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-variate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has made large strides (with very negligible errors) through recent advancements in neural networks, e.g., Transformers. However, in critical situations like predicting gaming overindulgence that affects one's mental well-being; an accurate forecast without a contributing evidence (explanation) is irrelevant. Hence, it becomes important that the forecasts are Interpretable - intermediate representation of the forecasted trajectory is comprehensible; as well as Explainable - attentive input features and events are accessible for a personalized and timely intervention of players at risk. While the contributing state of the art research on interpretability primarily focuses on temporally-smooth single-process driven time series data, our online multi-player gameplay data demonstrates intractable temporal randomness due to intrinsic orthogonality between player's game outcome and their intent to engage further. We introduce a novel deep Actionable Forecasting Network (AFN), which addresses the inter-dependent challenges associated with three exclusive objectives - 1) forecasting accuracy; 2) smooth comprehensible trajectory and 3) explanations via multi-dimensional input features while tackling the challenges introduced by our non-smooth temporal data, together in one single solution. AFN establishes a \it{new benchmark} via: (i) achieving 25% improvement on the MSE of the forecasts on player data in comparison to the SOM-VAE based SOTA networks; (ii) attributing unfavourable progression of a player's time series to a specific future time step(s), with the premise of eliminating near-future overindulgent player volume by over 18% with player specific actionable inputs feature(s) and (iii) proactively detecting over 23% (100% jump from SOTA) of the to-be overindulgent, players on an average, 4 weeks in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA: Unsupervised 2D Temporal Dependency Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02498v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is essential for uncovering rare and potentially harmful events in unlabeled time series data. Existing methods are highly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to noise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal relationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in traditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies. We introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series Decomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to decompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2) Temporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal correlation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and 3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor to integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient representation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and easy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on five multivariate TSAD benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEXtime: Filterbank learning to explain time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05841v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions from time series involve learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step; however, many types of time series are difficult to interpret in the time domain, due to the inherently complex nature of the data. Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio.

| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected from sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Movement-Prediction-Adjusted Naïve Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast, which is the original na\"ive forecast with the addition of a weighted movement prediction term, in the context of forecasting time series that exhibit symmetric random walk properties. The weight of the movement term is determined by two parameters: one reflecting the directional accuracy and the other representing the mean absolute increment. The settings of the two parameters involve a trade-off: larger values may yield meaningful gains over the original na\"ive forecast, whereas smaller values often render the adjusted forecast more reliable. This trade-off can be managed by empirically setting the parameters using sliding windows on in-sample data. To statistically test the performance of the adjusted na\"ive forecast under different directional accuracy levels, we used four synthetic time series to simulate multiple forecast scenarios, assuming that for each directional accuracy level, diverse movement predictions were provided. The simulation results show that as the directional accuracy increases, the error of the adjusted na\"ive forecast decreases. In particular, the adjusted na\"ive forecast achieves statistically significant improvements over the original na\"ive forecast, even under a low directional accuracy of slightly above 0.50. This finding implies that the movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast can serve as a new optimal point forecast for time series with symmetric random walk characteristics if consistent movement prediction can be provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastFlow: Early Yet Robust Network Flow Classification using the Minimal Number of Time-Series Packets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02174v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification is of great importance for network operators in their daily routines, such as analyzing the usage patterns of multimedia applications and optimizing network configurations. Internet service providers (ISPs) that operate high-speed links expect network flow classifiers to accurately classify flows early, using the minimal number of necessary initial packets per flow. These classifiers must also be robust to packet sequence disorders in candidate flows and capable of detecting unseen flow types that are not within the existing classification scope, which are not well achieved by existing methods. In this paper, we develop FastFlow, a time-series flow classification method that accurately classifies network flows as one of the known types or the unknown type, which dynamically selects the minimal number of packets to balance accuracy and efficiency. Toward the objectives, we first develop a flow representation process that converts packet streams at both per-packet and per-slot granularity for precise packet statistics with robustness to packet sequence disorders. Second, we develop a sequential decision-based classification model that leverages LSTM architecture trained with reinforcement learning. Our model makes dynamic decisions on the minimal number of time-series data points per flow for the confident classification as one of the known flow types or an unknown one. We evaluated our method on public datasets and demonstrated its superior performance in early and accurate flow classification. Deployment insights on the classification of over 22.9 million flows across seven application types and 33 content providers in a campus network over one week are discussed, showing that FastFlow requires an average of only 8.37 packets and 0.5 seconds to classify the application type of a flow with over 91% accuracy and over 96% accuracy for the content providers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025.

Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, conditionally accepted to ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Meta-learning approaches aim to automate this process, but they typically depend on pre-constructed performance matrices, which are costly to build. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lightweight alternative for model selection. Our method eliminates the need for explicit performance matrices by utilizing the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA, GPT and Gemini, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional meta-learning techniques and heuristic baselines, while significantly reducing computational overhead. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in efficient model selection for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 Figures |

Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

The inference relies on time-delay embedding, estimation of the intrinsic dimension of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. A key component of our approach is a new anisotropic training technique applied to Kohonen's self-organizing map, which effectively learns the attractor of the driven system and separates it into submanifolds corresponding to the self-dynamics and shared dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted simulated experiments using different chaotic maps in a setup, where two chaotic maps were driven by a third map with nonlinear coupling. The inferred time series exhibited high correlation with the time series of the actual hidden common driver, in contrast to the observed systems. The quality of our reconstruction were compared and shown to be superior to several other methods that are intended to find the common features behind the observed time series, including linear methods like PCA and ICA as well as nonlinear methods like dynamical component analysis, canonical correlation analysis and even deep canonical correlation analysis.</p></details> |  |

These recordings encode the recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 391 TS from four benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than five state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[Augmentation of EEG and ECG Time Series for Deep Learning Applications: Integrating Changepoint Detection into the iAAFT Surrogates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03761v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of deep learning methods critically depends on the quality and quantity of the available training data. This is especially the case for physiological time series, which are both noisy and scarce, which calls for data augmentation to artificially increase the size of datasets. Another issue is that the time-evolving statistical properties of nonstationary signals prevent the use of standard data augmentation techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel method for augmenting nonstationary time series. This is achieved by combining offline changepoint detection with the iterative amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT), which ensures that the time-frequency properties of the original signal are preserved during augmentation. The proposed method is validated through comparisons of the performance of i) a deep learning seizure detection algorithm on both the original and augmented versions of the CHB-MIT and Siena scalp electroencephalography (EEG) databases, and ii) a deep learning atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm on the original and augmented versions of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset. By virtue of the proposed method, for the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets respectively, accuracy rose by 4.4% and 1.9%, precision by 10% and 5.5%, recall by 3.6% and 0.9%, and F1 by 4.2% and 1.4%. For the AF classification task, accuracy rose by 0.3%, precision by 2.1%, recall by 0.8%, and F1 by 2.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

The core challenge lies in effectively modeling dependencies both within sequences and channels. Convolutional Neural Networks and Linear models often excel in sequence modeling but frequently fall short in capturing complex channel dependencies. In contrast, Transformer-based models, with their attention mechanisms applied to both sequences and channels, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. Our research proposes a new approach for capturing sequence and channel dependencies: AverageTime, an exceptionally simple yet effective structure. By employing mixed channel embedding and averaging operations, AverageTime separately captures correlations for sequences and channels through channel mapping and result averaging. In addition, we integrate clustering methods to further accelerate the model's training process. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AverageTime surpasses state-of-the-art models in predictive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to lightweight linear models. This provides a new and effective framework for modeling long time series.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel approach using a prefixed patch time series Transformer model that automates the solution of two-point boundary value problems from lunar flyby to arbitrary terminal conditions. Using prefix tokens of terminal conditions in our deep generative model enables solving boundary value problems in three-body dynamics. The training dataset consists of trajectories obtained through forward propagation rather than solving boundary value problems directly. The model demonstrates potential practical utility for preliminary trajectory design in cislunar mission scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |

Copyright may be transferred without noticeafter which this version may no longer be accessible." Time series modeling serves as the cornerstone of real-world applications, such as weather forecasting and transportation management. Recently, Mamba has become a promising model that combines near-linear computational complexity with high prediction accuracy in time series modeling, while facing challenges such as insufficient modeling of nonlinear dependencies in attention and restricted receptive fields caused by convolutions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative framework, Attention Mamba, featuring a novel Adaptive Pooling block that accelerates attention computation and incorporates global information, effectively overcoming the constraints of limited receptive fields. Furthermore, Attention Mamba integrates a bidirectional Mamba block, efficiently capturing long-short features and transforming inputs into the Value representations for attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets underscore the effectiveness of Attention Mamba in extracting nonlinear dependencies and enhancing receptive fields, establishing superior performance among leading counterparts.

| **[FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that offers broad applicability similar to MLP while effectively addressing periodicity modeling challenges. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach maintains the general-purpose modeling capability. Therefore, FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various model architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, e.g., symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image recognition.</p></details> |  |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Temporal Data Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16959v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data modelling techniques with neural networks are useful in many domain applications, including time-series forecasting and control engineering. This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress, it becomes challenging in the presence of noise, especially when derivatives need to be calculated. To reduce the effect of noise, we propose a method that simultaneously fits both the derivative and trajectory from noisy time-series data. Our approach formulates derivative estimation as an inverse problem involving integral operators within the forward model, and estimates the derivative function by solving a regularization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS). We derive an integral-form representer theorem, which enables the computation of the regularized solution by solving a finite-dimensional problem and facilitates efficiently estimating the optimal regularization parameter. By embedding the dynamics within a vRKHS and utilizing the fitted derivative and trajectory, we can recover the underlying dynamics from noisy data by solving a linear regularization problem. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although these methods provide an elegant and powerful solution in static settings, they struggle in the presence of dynamic motions that disrupt alignment based solely on camera poses. To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D pointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene geometry in a feed-forward manner. By explicitly incorporating both spatial and temporal aspects, our approach successfully encapsulates spatio-temporal dense correspondence to the proposed 4D pointmaps, enhancing downstream tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance across various datasets featuring complex motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/DDUSt3R/</p></details> |

It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely used in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or dynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or event-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur, enhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse lighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these advantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using DVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated event-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study introduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset, capturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream using DVS.In addition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image frames captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS). Both data types were collected using the DAVIS346 camera, which integrates DVS and APS sensors.The dataset focuses on two types of defects: cracks and spalling, and includes data from both field and laboratory environments. The field dataset comprises 318 recording sequences,documenting 458 distinct cracks and 121 distinct spalling instances.The laboratory dataset includes 362 recording sequences, covering 220 distinct cracks and 308 spalling instances.Four realtime object detection models were evaluated on it to validate the dataset effectiveness.The results demonstrate the dataset robustness in enabling accurate defect detection and classification,even under challenging lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A jou...</summary><p>A journal paper which submitted to Sage SHM journa and it is under review currently. consist of 25 pages.

Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios.

For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) captures geographic and interactive factors-such as coaching exchange and socio-economic links-while the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module models historical trends in medal counts, economic data, and demographics. To address zero-inflated outputs (i.e., the disparity between countries that consistently yield wins and those never having won medals), a Zero-Inflated Compound Poisson (ZICP) framework is incorporated to separate random zeros from structural zeros, providing a clearer view of potential breakthrough performances. Validation includes historical backtracking, policy shock simulations, and causal inference checks, confirming the robustness of the proposed method. Results shed light on the influence of coaching mobility, event specialization, and strategic investment on medal forecasts, offering a data-driven foundation for optimizing sports policies and resource allocation in diverse Olympic contexts.</p></details> | 18pages, 7figures |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

The method utilizes geographic and sociodemographic information to represent the fleet's mobility and driving energy needs. It models the charging decisions of drivers based on their driving energy needs and range comfort level using real-world data. The flexibility quantification provides an hourly maximum and minimum bound for the charging power and limits the amount of daily flexible charging energy. We apply the methodology to the future fully electrified fleet of Switzerland as a case study and compare the spatio-temporal characteristics of the charging demand and flexibility of different geographic areas and urbanization levels.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DP-LET: An Efficient Spatio-Temporal Network Traffic Prediction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03792v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Building such a generalizable model is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing image-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static human). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model as a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background harmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting model that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos without any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is combined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending algorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a post-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image. In the experiments, Comprehensive Relighting shows a strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing image-based human relighting and harmonization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://junyingw.github.io/paper/relighting.

| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

| **[GSR4B: Biomass Map Super-Resolution with Sentinel-1/2 Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01722v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) mapping at both large scale and high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for applications ranging from climate modeling to biodiversity assessment, and sustainable supply chain monitoring. At present, fine-grained AGB mapping relies on costly airborne laser scanning acquisition campaigns usually limited to regional scales. Initiatives such as the ESA CCI map attempt to generate global biomass products from diverse spaceborne sensors but at a coarser resolution. To enable global, high-resolution (HR) mapping, several works propose to regress AGB from HR satellite observations such as ESA Sentinel-1/2 images. We propose a novel way to address HR AGB estimation, by leveraging both HR satellite observations and existing low-resolution (LR) biomass products. We cast this problem as Guided Super-Resolution (GSR), aiming at upsampling LR biomass maps (sources) from $100$ to $10$ m resolution, using auxiliary HR co-registered satellite images (guides). We compare super-resolving AGB maps with and without guidance, against direct regression from satellite images, on the public BioMassters dataset. We observe that Multi-Scale Guidance (MSG) outperforms direct regression both for regression ($-780$ t/ha RMSE) and perception ($+2.0$ dB PSNR) metrics, and better captures high-biomass values, without significant computational overhead. Interestingly, unlike the RGB+Depth setting they were originally designed for, our best-performing AGB GSR approaches are those that most preserve the guide image texture. Our results make a strong case for adopting the GSR framework for accurate HR biomass mapping at scale. Our code and model weights are made publicly available (https://github.com/kaankaramanofficial/GSR4B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation at the ISPRS Geospatial Week 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods face challenges such as complex interaction and limited control capabilities. To address these issues, we present OmniCam, a unified multimodal camera control framework. Leveraging large language models and video diffusion models, OmniCam generates spatio-temporally consistent videos. It supports various combinations of input modalities: the user can provide text or video with expected trajectory as camera path guidance, and image or video as content reference, enabling precise control over camera motion. To facilitate the training of OmniCam, we introduce the OmniTr dataset, which contains a large collection of high-quality long-sequence trajectories, videos, and corresponding descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-quality camera-controlled video generation across various metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected from sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowDistill: Scalable Traffic Flow Prediction via Distillation from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02094v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow prediction is vital for optimizing urban mobility, yet it remains difficult in many cities due to complex spatio-temporal dependencies and limited high-quality data. While deep graph-based models demonstrate strong predictive power, their performance often comes at the cost of high computational overhead and substantial training data requirements, making them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained or data-scarce environments. We propose the FlowDistill, a lightweight and scalable traffic prediction framework based on knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). In this teacher-student setup, a fine-tuned LLM guides a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP) student model using a novel combination of the information bottleneck principle and teacher-bounded regression loss, ensuring the distilled model retains only essential and transferable knowledge. Spatial and temporal correlations are explicitly encoded to enhance the model's generalization across diverse urban settings. Despite its simplicity, FlowDistill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy while requiring significantly less training data, and achieving lower memory usage and inference latency, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for real-world, scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[Efficient 3D Recognition with Event-driven Spike Sparse Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07360v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. Point clouds are sparse 3D spatial data, which suggests that SNNs should be well-suited for processing them. However, when applying SNNs to point clouds, they often exhibit limited performance and fewer application scenarios. We attribute this to inappropriate preprocessing and feature extraction methods. To address this issue, we first introduce the Spike Voxel Coding (SVC) scheme, which encodes the 3D point clouds into a sparse spike train space, reducing the storage requirements and saving time on point cloud preprocessing. Then, we propose a Spike Sparse Convolution (SSC) model for efficiently extracting 3D sparse point cloud features. Combining SVC and SSC, we design an efficient 3D SNN backbone (E-3DSNN), which is friendly with neuromorphic hardware. For instance, SSC can be implemented on neuromorphic chips with only minor modifications to the addressing function of vanilla spike convolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, KITTI, and Semantic KITTI datasets demonstrate that E-3DSNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with remarkable efficiency. Notably, our E-3DSNN (1.87M) obtained 91.7\% top-1 accuracy on ModelNet40, surpassing the current best SNN baselines (14.3M) by 3.0\%. To our best knowledge, it is the first direct training 3D SNN backbone that can simultaneously handle various 3D computer vision tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation) with an event-driven nature.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the Spiking Dynamic Graph Network (SDGN), a novel framework that leverages the temporal processing capabilities of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to dynamically estimate underlying spatio-temporal functional graphs. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined or static graph structures, SDGN adapts to any dataset by learning dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies directly from the event data, enhancing generalizability and robustness. While SDGN offers significant improvements over prior methods, we acknowledge its limitations in handling dense graphs and certain non-Gaussian dependencies, providing opportunities for future refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets including NYC Taxi, 911, Reddit, and Stack Overflow, demonstrate that SDGN achieves superior predictive accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we include ablation studies to highlight the contributions of its core components.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model. Due to temporal consistent predictions, we outperform prior art in 3D Zero-Shot Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS) over $5$ PQ, and unlock Zero-Shot 4D-LPS.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While carbon-aware workload migration strategies have been examined, existing approaches often overlook reliability metrics such as server lifetime degradation, and quality-of-service (QoS) that substantially affects both carbon and operational efficiency of DCs. Hence, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization framework for spatio-temporal workload migration across distributed DCs that jointly minimizes operational and embodied carbon emissions while complying with service-level agreements (SLA). A key contribution is the development of an embodied carbon emission model based on servers' expected lifetime analysis, which explicitly considers server heterogeneity resulting from aging and utilization conditions. These issues are accommodated using new server dispatch strategies, and backup resource allocation model, accounting hardware, software and workload-induced failure. The overall model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem with multiple linearization techniques to ensure computational tractability. Numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces total carbon emissions by up to 21%, offering a pragmatic approach to sustainable DC operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been submitted for review to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units to model the temporal sequence of sparse sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatio-temporal field from the latent state space. Our algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization for which the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, a Koopman-SHRED model is generated. SINDy-SHRED (i) learns a symbolic and interpretable generative model of a parsimonious and low-dimensional latent space for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) discovers new physics models even for well-known physical systems, (iii) achieves provably robust convergence with an observed globally convex loss landscape, and (iv) achieves superior accuracy, data efficiency, and training time, all with fewer model parameters. We conduct systematic experimental studies on PDE data such as turbulent flows, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. The interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enable stable and accurate long-term video predictions, outperforming all current baseline deep learning models in accuracy, training time, and data requirements, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |

Having knowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time slots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby increasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing idle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global supply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to 45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning approaches often operate as black boxes and are vulnerable to spurious correlations, limiting both their reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce FineCausal, a novel causal-based framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineDiving-HM dataset. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network-based causal intervention module to disentangle human-centric foreground cues from background confounders, and incorporates a temporal causal attention module to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies across action stages. This dual-module strategy enables FineCausal to generate detailed spatio-temporal representations that not only achieve state-of-the-art scoring performance but also provide transparent, interpretable feedback on which features drive the assessment. Despite its strong performance, FineCausal requires extensive expert knowledge to define causal structures and depends on high-quality annotations, challenges that we discuss and address as future research directions.

| **[A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform Band-pass Filter Extension for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23493v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces a novel extension, called the Extended Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (EKZFT), to an existing class of band-pass filters first introduced by Kolmogorov and Zurbenko. Their original Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (KZFT) is a useful tool in time series and spatio-temporal analysis, Fourier analysis, and related statistical analysis fields. Example uses of these filters include separating frequencies, filtering portions of the spectra, reconstructing seasonality, investigating periodic signals, and reducing noise. KZFT filters have many practical applications across a wide range of disciplines including health, social, natural, and physical sciences. KZFT filters are band-pass filters defined by three arguments: the length of the filter window; the number of iterations; and the central frequency of the band-pass filter. However, the KZFT filter is limited in design to only positive odd integer widow lengths inherited from the time series. Therefore, for any combination of the other KZFT filter arguments, there is only a relatively small, discrete, selection of possible filter window lengths in a range determined by the size of the dataset. This limits the utility of KZFT filters for many of the stated uses. The proposed EKZFT filter allows a continuous selection of filter window length arguments over the same range, offering improved control, increased functionality, and wider practical use of this band-pass filter. An example application of the EKZFT in a data simulation is provided.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing actions in videos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address this, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange information and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding, we extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in Visual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different characteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400, consistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on audio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound, KineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across these datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among multiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and CAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention, achieving balanced and holistic video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, TPAMI under review</p></details> |
| **[MMAD: Multi-label Micro-Action Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05311v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks. Our code, model, and dataset will be made publicly available at https://javisdit.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Mutli-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Crop Yields Forecasts With Spatio-Temporal Conditional Copula Using Extreme Weather Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22807v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel forecasting model for crop yields that explicitly accounts for spatio-temporal dependence and the influence of extreme weather and climatic events. Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

The most current approach to processing Event Cloud often involves converting it into frame-based representations, which neglects the sparsity of events, loses fine-grained temporal information, and increases the computational burden. In contrast, Point Cloud is a popular representation for processing 3-dimensional data and serves as an alternative method to exploit local and global spatial features. Nevertheless, previous point-based methods show an unsatisfactory performance compared to the frame-based method in dealing with spatio-temporal event streams. In order to bridge the gap, we propose EventMamba, an efficient and effective framework based on Point Cloud representation by rethinking the distinction between Event Cloud and Point Cloud, emphasizing vital temporal information. The Event Cloud is subsequently fed into a hierarchical structure with staged modules to process both implicit and explicit temporal features. Specifically, we redesign the global extractor to enhance explicit temporal extraction among a long sequence of events with temporal aggregation and State Space Model (SSM) based Mamba. Our model consumes minimal computational resources in the experiments and still exhibits SOTA point-based performance on six different scales of action recognition datasets. It even outperformed all frame-based methods on both Camera Pose Relocalization (CPR) and eye-tracking regression tasks.

We study the use of the Greta software for Bayesian inference to apply Gaussian process regression to spatio-temporal data of infectious disease outbreaks and predict future disease spread. Greta builds on Tensorflow, making it comparatively easy to take advantage of the significant gain in speed offered by GPUs. In these complex spatio-temporal models, we show a reduction of up to 70\% in computational time relative to fitting the same models on CPUs. We show how the choice of covariance kernel impacts the ability to infer spread and extrapolate to unobserved spatial and temporal units. The inference pipeline is applied to weekly incidence data on tuberculosis in the East and West Midlands regions of England over a period of two years.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Any Motion in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22268v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for achieving a high-level understanding of visual scenes and has numerous downstream applications. Humans can effortlessly segment moving objects in videos. Previous work has largely relied on optical flow to provide motion cues; however, this approach often results in imperfect predictions due to challenges such as partial motion, complex deformations, motion blur and background distractions. We propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation that combines long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features and leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification through an iterative prompting strategy. Our model employs Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Attention and Motion-Semantic Decoupled Embedding to prioritize motion while integrating semantic support. Extensive testing on diverse datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, excelling in challenging scenarios and fine-grained segmentation of multiple objects.

These data not only reveal users' spatio-temporal information but also provide insights into their behavior patterns and interests. However, cross-platform identity linkage faces challenges like poor data quality, high sparsity, and noise interference, which hinder existing methods from extracting cross-platform user information. To address these issues, we propose a Correlation-Attention Masked Transformer for User Identity Linkage Network (MT-Link), a transformer-based framework to enhance model performance by learning spatio-temporal co-occurrence patterns of cross-platform users. Our model effectively captures spatio-temporal co-occurrence in cross-platform user check-in sequences. It employs a correlation attention mechanism to detect the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between user check-in sequences. Guided by attention weight maps, the model focuses on co-occurrence points while filtering out noise, ultimately improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 12.92%~17.76% and 5.80%~8.38% improvements in terms of Macro-F1 and Area Under Curve (AUC).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recent studies focus on integrating spatiotemporal information obtained from past observations to improve prediction accuracy, using a multi-frame fusion approach that processes multiple past frames together. However, these methods struggle with a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which significantly limits their practicality. To mitigate this trade-off, we propose StreamOcc, a novel framework that aggregates spatio-temporal information in a stream-based manner. StreamOcc consists of two key components: (i) Stream-based Voxel Aggregation, which effectively accumulates past observations while minimizing computational costs, and (ii) Query-guided Aggregation, which recurrently aggregates instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features, refining fine-grained details of dynamic objects. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that StreamOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time settings, while reducing memory usage by more than 50% compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

Accurate estimation of ride-sharing improves service utilization and reliability and reduces travel time and traffic congestion. In this study, we employ two Bayesian models to estimate ride-sharing demand in the 77 Chicago community areas. We consider demographic, scoio-economic, transportation factors as well as land-use characteristics as explanatory variables. Our models assume conditional autoregression (CAR) prior for the explanatory variables. Moreover, the Bayesian frameworks estimate both the unstructured random error and the struc-tured errors for the spatial and the spatiotemporal correlation. We assessed the performance of the estimated models and the residuals of the spatial regression model have no left-over spatial structure. For the spatiotemporal model, the squared correlation between actual ride-shares and the fitted values is 0.95. Our analysis revealed that the demographic factors (populations size and registered crimes) positively impact the ride-sharing demand. Additionally, the ride-sharing demand increases with higher income and increase in the economically active propor-tion of the population as well as the residents with no cars. Moreover, the transit availability and the walkability indices are crucial determinants for the ridesharing in Chicago.</p></details> |  |

In the context of spatially distributed CPS, these connections can be dynamically dependent on the spatial configuration of the various components and agents. In these settings, robust monitoring of the distributed components is vital to ensuring complex behaviors are achieved, and safety properties are maintained. To this end, we look at defining the automaton semantics for the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a formal logic designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over mobile, spatially distributed CPS. Specifically, STREL reasons about spatio-temporal behavior over dynamic weighted graphs. While STREL is endowed with well defined qualitative and quantitative semantics, in this paper, we propose a novel construction of (weighted) alternating finite automata from STREL specifications that efficiently encodes these semantics. Moreover, we demonstrate how this automaton semantics can be used to perform both, offline and online monitoring for STREL specifications using a simulated drone swarm environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HSCC 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA.

Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

Current video-language models typically rely on heavyweight image encoders (300M-1.1B parameters) or video encoders (1B-1.4B parameters), creating a substantial computational burden when processing multi-frame videos. Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5$\times$ reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention and separate mechanisms for modeling frame-level and video-level relationships. Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding. Extensive ablation studies validate our architectural choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of our spatio-temporal modeling approach while achieving 3-4$\times$ faster processing speeds than previous methods.

However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in the geospatial-temporal modelling field have focused on the inclusion of geographical weighting in their deep learning models to account for nonspatial stationarity, which is often apparent in spatial data. We formulate a novel semi-analytical approach to solving Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR), and applying it to London crime data. The results produce high-accuracy predictive evaluation scores that affirm the validity of the assumptions and approximations in the approach. This paper presents mathematical advances to the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Neural Network (GTWNN) framework, which offers a novel contribution to the field. Insights from past literature are harmoniously employed with the assumptions and approximations to generate three mathematical extensions to GTWNN's framework. Combinations of these extensions produce five novel ANNs, applied to the London and Detroit datasets. The results suggest that one of the extensions is redundant and is generally surpassed by another extension, which we term the history-dependent module. The remaining extensions form three novel ANN designs that pose potential GTWNN improvements. We evaluated the efficacy of various models in both the London and Detroit crime datasets, highlighting the importance of accounting for specific geographic and temporal characteristics when selecting modelling strategies to improve model suitability. In general, the proposed methods provide the foundations for a more context-aware, accurate, and robust ANN approach in spatio-temporal modelling.</p></details> |  |

We suppose spatial interference is described by a graph, where a unit's outcome depends on its neighborhood's treatments, and that temporal interference is described by an MDP, where the transition kernel under either treatment (action) satisfies a rapid mixing condition. We propose a clustered switchback design, where units are grouped into clusters and time steps are grouped into blocks, and each whole cluster-block combination is assigned a single random treatment. Under this design, we show that for graphs that admit good clustering, a truncated Horvitz-Thompson estimator achieves a $\tilde O(1/NT)$ mean squared error (MSE), matching the lower bound up to logarithmic terms for sparse graphs. Our results simultaneously generalize the results from \citet{hu2022switchback,ugander2013graph} and \citet{leung2022rate}. Simulation studies validate the favorable performance of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{UniSTD}, a unified Transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal modeling, which is inspired by advances in recent foundation models with the two-stage pretraining-then-adaption paradigm. Specifically, our work demonstrates that task-agnostic pretraining on 2D vision and vision-text datasets can build a generalizable model foundation for spatiotemporal learning, followed by specialized joint training on spatiotemporal datasets to enhance task-specific adaptability. To improve the learning capabilities across domains, our framework employs a rank-adaptive mixture-of-expert adaptation by using fractional interpolation to relax the discrete variables so that can be optimized in the continuous space. Additionally, we introduce a temporal module to incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset covering 10 tasks across 4 disciplines, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal model can achieve scalable, cross-task learning and support up to 10 tasks simultaneously within one model while reducing training costs in multi-domain applications.

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

However, this produces a dependency on provider resources. Moreover, managing and executing tasks and data in these environments are challenges that commonly arise when building an EOS. This paper presents GeoNimbus, a serverless framework for composing and deploying spatio-temporal EOS on multiple infrastructures, e.g., on-premise resources and public or private clouds. This framework organizes EOS tasks as functions and automatically manages their deployment, invocation, scalability, and monitoring in the cloud. GeoNimbus framework enables organizations to reuse and share available functions to compose multiple EOS.

Given these challenges, the recently proposed Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) emerges as a potential candidate due to its ability to generate coherent segmentation mask tracks across video frames, and provide an inherent spatio-temporal objectness in its object token representations. In this paper, we introduce SOLA (Selection by Object Language Alignment), a novel framework that leverages SAM2 object tokens as compact video-level object representations, which are aligned with language features through a lightweight track selection module. To effectively facilitate this alignment, we propose an IoU-based pseudo-labeling strategy, which bridges the modality gap between SAM2 representations with language features. Extensive experiments show that SOLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MeViS dataset and demonstrate that SOLA offers an effective solution for RVOS.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

Conventional forecasting methods often neglect the power grid's inherent topology, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a topology aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting power system states under high renewable integration. We construct a graph based representation of the power network, modeling buses and transmission lines as nodes and edges, and introduce a specialized GNN architecture that integrates GraphSAGE convolutions with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model both spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics. The model is trained and evaluated on the NREL 118 test system using realistic, time synchronous renewable generation profiles. Our results show that the proposed GNN outperforms baseline approaches including fully connected neural networks, linear regression, and rolling mean models, achieving substantial improvements in predictive accuracy. The GNN achieves average RMSEs of 0.13 to 0.17 across all predicted variables and demonstrates consistent performance across spatial locations and operational conditions. These results highlight the potential of topology aware learning for scalable and robust power system forecasting in future grids with high renewable penetration.</p></details> |  |

However, designing computationally efficient methods remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a Mamba-based framework called MamBEV, which learns unified Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations using linear spatio-temporal SSM-based attention. This approach supports multiple 3D perception tasks with significantly improved computational and memory efficiency.

| **[Truck Parking Usage Prediction with Decomposed Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12920v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truck parking on freight corridors faces the major challenge of insufficient parking spaces. This is exacerbated by the Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations, which often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. It has been shown that providing accurate parking usage prediction can be a cost-effective solution to reduce unsafe parking practices. In light of this, existing studies have developed various methods to predict the usage of a truck parking site and have demonstrated satisfactory accuracy. However, these studies focused on a single parking site, and few approaches have been proposed to predict the usage of multiple truck parking sites considering spatio-temporal dependencies, due to the lack of data. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents the Regional Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RegT-GCN) to predict parking usage across the entire state to provide more comprehensive truck parking information. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site locations and historical parking data to predict the occupancy rate considering spatio-temporal dependencies across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics of the truck parking locations and their spatial correlations. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models, showing the effectiveness of our regional decomposition.

This work addresses the critical need to explicitly incorporate ensemble parameters into the learning process, as traditional methods often neglect these, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse simulation settings and provide meaningful insights into the data dynamics. HyperFLINT introduces a hypernetwork to account for simulation parameters, enabling it to generate accurate interpolations and flow fields for each timestep by dynamically adapting to varying conditions, thereby outperforming existing parameter-agnostic approaches. The architecture features modular neural blocks with convolutional and deconvolutional layers, supported by a hypernetwork that generates weights for the main network, allowing the model to better capture intricate simulation dynamics. A series of experiments demonstrates HyperFLINT's significantly improved performance in flow field estimation and temporal interpolation, as well as its potential in enabling parameter space exploration, offering valuable insights into complex scientific ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupled Dynamics Framework with Neural Fields for 3D Spatio-temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a neural framework that predicts 3D vehicle collision dynamics by independently modeling global rigid-body motion and local structural deformation. Unlike approaches directly predicting absolute displacement, this method explicitly separates the vehicle's overall translation and rotation from its structural deformation. Two specialized networks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid motion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By independently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed architecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate supervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available simulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with prediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates strong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range, accurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme velocities and large impact angles. Furthermore, the framework successfully reconstructs high-resolution deformation details from low-resolution inputs without increased computational effort. Consequently, the proposed approach provides an effective, computationally efficient method for rapid and reliable assessment of vehicle safety across complex collision scenarios, substantially reducing the required simulation data and time while preserving prediction fidelity.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation.

However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modeling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

This one-parameter benchmark equation is derived from a general one-dimensional first-order SDE using spatio-temporal nondimensionalization and is employed to evaluate the performance of (1) Euler-Maruyama (EM), (2) Milstein (Mil), (3) Stochastic Heun (SH), and (4) a three-stage Runge-Kutta scheme (RK3). Our findings reveal that lower-order schemes can outperform higher-order ones over a range of time step sizes, depending on the benchmark parameters and application context. The theoretical results are validated through a series of numerical experiments, and we discuss their implications for more general applications, including a nonlinear example of particle transport in porous media under various conditions. Our results suggest that the insights obtained from the linear benchmark problem provide reliable guidance for time-stepping strategies when simulating nonlinear SDEs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions. SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities. We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality. We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild datasets.We argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding silhouettes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures, and the results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed alignment strategy.Specifically, on the challenging Gait3D dataset, our method achieved an average performance improvement of 7.9% across all evaluated networks. Furthermore, our method achieves substantial improvements on cross-domain datasets, with accuracy improvements of up to 24.0%.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face limitations in effectively comprehending the complex evolutions of driving scenes over time. This paper proposes FM4SU, a novel methodology for training a symbolic foundation model (FM) for scene understanding in autonomous driving. It leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture sensory observation along with domain knowledge such as road topology, traffic rules, or complex interactions between traffic participants. A bird's eye view (BEV) symbolic representation is extracted from the KG for each driving scene, including the spatio-temporal information among the objects across the scenes. The BEV representation is serialized into a sequence of tokens and given to pre-trained language models (PLMs) for learning an inherent understanding of the co-occurrence among driving scene elements and generating predictions on the next scenes. We conducted a number of experiments using the nuScenes dataset and KG in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy in all tasks. The fine-tuned T5 model achieved a next scene prediction accuracy of 86.7%. This paper concludes that FM4SU offers a promising foundation for developing more comprehensive models for scene understanding in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Unlearning toxic motions is challenging as those can be generated from explicit text prompts and from implicit toxic combinations of safe motions (e.g., ``kicking" is ``loading and swinging a leg"). We propose the first motion unlearning benchmark by filtering toxic motions from the large and recent text-to-motion datasets of HumanML3D and Motion-X. We propose baselines, by adapting state-of-the-art image unlearning techniques to process spatio-temporal signals. Finally, we propose a novel motion unlearning model based on Latent Code Replacement, which we dub LCR. LCR is training-free and suitable to the discrete latent spaces of state-of-the-art text-to-motion diffusion models. LCR is simple and consistently outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. Project page: \href{https://www.pinlab.org/hmu}{https://www.pinlab.org/hmu}.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the diffusion model, which demonstrates unprecedented generative potential, has been explored in image fusion. However, these approaches typically incorporate predefined multimodal guidance into diffusion, failing to capture the dynamically changing significance of each modality, while lacking theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we reveal a significant spatio-temporal imbalance in image denoising; specifically, the diffusion model produces dynamic information gains in different image regions with denoising steps. Based on this observation, we Dig into the Diffusion Information Gains (Dig2DIG) and theoretically derive a diffusion-based dynamic image fusion framework that provably reduces the upper bound of the generalization error. Accordingly, we introduce diffusion information gains (DIG) to quantify the information contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, thereby providing dynamic guidance during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple fusion scenarios confirm that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in terms of both fusion quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the following contributions. First, we present a large-scale automatic annotation method that aggregates captions grounded with bounding boxes across individual frames into temporally dense and consistent bounding box annotations. We apply this approach on the HowTo100M dataset to construct a large-scale pre-training dataset, named HowToGround1M. We also introduce a Grounded Video Caption Generation model, dubbed GROVE, and pre-train the model on HowToGround1M. Second, we introduce a new dataset, called iGround, of 3500 videos with manually annotated captions and dense spatio-temporally grounded bounding boxes. This allows us to measure progress on this challenging problem, as well as to fine-tune our model on this small-scale but high-quality data. Third, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed iGround dataset compared to a number of baselines, as well as on the VidSTG and ActivityNet-Entities datasets. We perform extensive ablations that demonstrate the importance of pre-training using our automatically annotated HowToGround1M dataset followed by fine-tuning on the manually annotated iGround dataset and validate the key technical contributions of our model.</p></details> |  |

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

We introduce several key innovations to improve the framework's efficiency and accuracy. First, we enhance the DeepONet architecture by incorporating a merge network that enables more complex feature interactions between operator and coordinate spaces, achieving a 50.4% reduction in prediction error compared to traditional dot-product operations. We further optimize the architecture through temporal positional encoding and point-based sampling strategies, achieving a 7.57% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing training time by 96% through efficient sampling and automatic mixed precision training. Building upon this foundation, we develop a transfer learning-based multi-fidelity framework that leverages knowledge from pre-trained low-fidelity models to guide high-fidelity predictions. Our approach freezes the pre-trained branch and trunk networks while making only the merge network trainable during high-fidelity training, preserving valuable low-fidelity representations while efficiently adapting to high-fidelity features. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that this fine-tuning strategy not only significantly outperforms linear probing and full-tuning alternatives but also surpasses conventional multi-fidelity frameworks by up to 76%, while achieving up to 43.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-fidelity training. The core contribution lies in our novel time-derivative guided sampling approach: it maintains prediction accuracy equivalent to models trained with the full dataset while requiring only 60% of the original high-fidelity samples.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we adopt a multi-loss function fusion strategy in the training phase to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between batches to optimize the training results. Finally, we also conducted actual deployment on embedded devices to extensively test the practical feasibility of the proposed method in existing work. We conduct extensive testing on three public datasets, including ablation studies, comparisons of related work, and embedded deployments.</p></details> |  |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 22 figures, accepted at the Learning on Graphs conference (LoG 2024)</p></details> |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04760v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 - CVPRW</p></details> |
| **[On the Hölder Stability of Multiset and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06984v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Substructure-Aware Expert Model for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05844v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiemannGFM: Learning a Graph Foundation Model from Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03251v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, pretraining a single model to offer cross-domain transferability on different datasets. Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Ensemble prediction systems provide probabilistic forecasts but exhibit biases and difficulties in capturing extreme weather. While post-processing techniques aim to enhance forecast accuracy, they rarely focus on precipitation, which exhibits complex spatial dependencies and tail behavior. Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution. This allows to capture spatial dependencies and improves forecast accuracy for extreme events, thus leading to more reliable forecasts and mitigating risks of extreme precipitation and flooding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025 - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop (https://www.climatechange.ai/events/iclr2025)</p></details> |
| **[GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |
| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04934v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions).

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Graph Neural Networks for Particle Track Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04670v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle track reconstruction is an important problem in high-energy physics (HEP), necessary to study properties of subatomic particles. Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems. Our work provides useful recommendations for software, system and hardware designers. PyGim is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/PyGim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14802v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at this URL https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Link_Prediction_with_PIGNN_IJCNN-F03F/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication.

| **[PIORF: Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow for Long-Range Interactions in Mesh Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04052v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, data-driven simulators based on graph neural networks have gained attention in modeling physical systems on unstructured meshes. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[TGraphX: Tensor-Aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-Dimensional Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03953v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TGraphX presents a novel paradigm in deep learning by unifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance visual reasoning tasks. Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

| **[PerLA: Perceptive 3D Language Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19774v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

The learned mesh generator outputs meshes that are comparable to those produced by Triangle and DistMesh, two popular Delaunay-based mesh generators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Quantum Circuits via ZX Diagrams using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03429v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is currently strongly limited by the impact of noise, in particular introduced by the application of two-qubit gates. For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Defense on the Fairness of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02757v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively.

We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters.

| **[A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Reducing Smoothness with Expressive Memory Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00349v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical forecasting models learn the structure of time series data via projecting onto a graph, with recent techniques capturing spatial-temporal associations between variables via edge weights. Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

| **[OmniCellTOSG: The First Cell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs Dataset for Joint LLM and GNN Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02148v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex cell signaling systems -- governed by varying protein abundances and interactions -- generate diverse cell types across organs. These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy data and rely on static graphs, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes between nodes and relationships. This paper introduces LL4G, a self-supervised framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to optimize graph neural networks (GNNs). LLMs extract rich semantic features to generate node representations and to infer explicit and implicit relationships. The graph structure adaptively adds nodes and edges based on input data, continuously optimizing itself. The GNN then uses these optimized representations for joint training on node reconstruction, edge prediction, and contrastive learning tasks. This integration of semantic and structural information generates robust personality profiles. Experimental results on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show LL4G outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Graph: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Explainability in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02064v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have relegated natural language processing tasks to Transformer-type models, particularly generative models, because these models exhibit high versatility when performing generation and classification tasks. As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task. The experiments delivered promising results in determining the most critical components within the text structure for a given classification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores.

We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

Obfuscation is one of the most used techniques to ensure such protection. Consequently, attackers must first detect and characterize obfuscation before launching any attack against it. This paper investigates the problem of function-level obfuscation detection using graph-based approaches, comparing algorithms, from elementary baselines to promising techniques like GNN (Graph Neural Networks), on different feature choices. We consider various obfuscation types and obfuscators, resulting in two complex datasets. Our findings demonstrate that GNNs need meaningful features that capture aspects of function semantics to outperform baselines. Our approach shows satisfactory results, especially in a challenging 11-class classification task and in a practical malware analysis example.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 13th International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications, Dec 2024, Istabul, Turkey</p></details> |

In recent years, various studies in the vision domain have made notable advancements in this area. However, the varying topological structures and non-grid nature of graph data render the methods from the vision domain ineffective. Building upon prior research into differentiable methods for graph neural networks, we propose a fast and high-quality data-free knowledge distillation approach in this paper. Without compromising distillation quality, the proposed graph-free KD method (ACGKD) significantly reduces the spatial complexity of pseudo-graphs by leveraging the Binary Concrete distribution to model the graph structure and introducing a spatial complexity tuning parameter. This approach enables efficient gradient computation for the graph structure, thereby accelerating the overall distillation process. Additionally, ACGKD eliminates the dimensional ambiguity between the student and teacher models by increasing the student's dimensions and reusing the teacher's classifier. Moreover, it equips graph knowledge distillation with a CL-based strategy to ensure the student learns graph structures progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACGKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</p></details> | Accepted at IEEE TMC |

Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as leading models in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 20 out of 22 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

We introduce several training improvements, particularly a novel closest assignment supervision method that dynamically adapts to the model's current state, significantly enhancing performance on problems with larger solution spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates, which achieve good accuracy on SAT assignment prediction while reducing computational demands. We extend the base graph neural network into a diffusion model that facilitates incremental sampling and can be effectively combined with classical techniques like unit propagation. Through analysis of embedding space patterns and optimization trajectories, we show how these networks implicitly perform a process very similar to continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, offering an interpretable view of their reasoning process. This understanding guides our design choices and explains the ability of recurrent architectures to scale effectively at inference time beyond their training distribution, which we demonstrate with test-time scaling experiments.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, our method yields a modest speedup of approximately 17% over conventional simulation techniques. These results indicate that the integration of deep learning with traditional physical simulation methods offers a promising pathway to significantly enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted in conference MAEB 2025 (more info at https://www.uik.eus/es/curso/xvi-congreso-espanol-metaheuristicas-algoritmos-evolutivos-bioinspirados)</p></details> |

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</p></details> |  |

Graphs from real-world datasets often evolve over time, with newly emerging edges and dynamically changing node properties, posing a significant challenge for this problem. In response, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to predict dynamic node properties from a stream of emerging edges. However, our analysis reveals that most TGNN-based methods are (a) far less effective without proper node features and, due to their complex model architectures, (b) vulnerable to distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose SPLASH, a simple yet powerful method for predicting node properties on edge streams under distribution shifts. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) we propose feature augmentation methods and an automatic feature selection method for edge streams, which improve the effectiveness of TGNNs, (2) we propose a lightweight MLP-based TGNN architecture that is highly efficient and robust under distribution shifts, and (3) we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and qualitative performance of the proposed method and its competitors on dynamic node classification, dynamic anomaly detection, and node affinity prediction tasks across seven real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, To Appear in ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures.

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs. We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance.

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</p></details> |  |

While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

While recent years have witnessed significant advances in this field, there has been limited effort to consolidate these works into a comprehensive overview. This survey systematically reviews the evolution and current state of lane topology reasoning methods, categorizing them into three major paradigms: procedural modeling-based methods, aerial imagery-based methods, and onboard sensors-based methods. We analyze the progression from early rule-based approaches to modern learning-based solutions utilizing transformers, graph neural networks (GNNs), and other deep learning architectures. The paper examines standardized evaluation metrics, including road-level measures (APLS and TLTS score), and lane-level metrics (DET and TOP score), along with performance comparisons on benchmark datasets such as OpenLane-V2. We identify key technical challenges, including dataset availability and model efficiency, and outline promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review provides researchers and practitioners with insights into the theoretical frameworks, practical implementations, and emerging trends in lane topology reasoning for HD mapping applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |

However, optimizing donor-acceptor (D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%, although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date, expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss plans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing AI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our predictive and generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI fo...</summary><p>AI for Accelerated Materials Design - ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19173v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical graph sampling based minibatch learning with chain preservation and variance reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00860v5)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sampling based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation during minibatch training, which exhibit good scalability in terms of layer depth and graph size. We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

| **[Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Eq: Discovering Mathematical Equations using Graph Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23617v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to discover meaningful, accurate, and concise mathematical equations that describe datasets is valuable across various domains. Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p></details> | SIGIR 2024 |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, while differential equations provide a principled framework for modeling continuous dynamics across time and space. The intersection of these fields has led to innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of both, enabling applications in physics-informed learning, spatiotemporal modeling, and scientific computing. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the burgeoning research at the intersection of GNNs and DEs.

Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

Certified robustness based on randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable guarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial perturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger robustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This excessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction consistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in real-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to achieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It integrates randomized smoothing with two key components, \underline{au}gmentation and con\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to improve data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a pre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving data quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a post-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes, thereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly enhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while maintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline randomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\%$ and certified accuracy by $409.3\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$ edges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying certifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.</p></details> | 20 pages |

As opposed to frame-based cameras, the motion-dependent nature of event cameras presents persistent challenges in achieving robust event feature detection and matching. In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods. We have also open-sourced our pipeline to facilitate research in the field: https://github.com/arclab-hku/SuperEIO.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning model that integrates messenger RNA, micro RNA sequences, and DNA methylation data with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for accurate and interpretable cancer classification across 31 cancer types. MOGKAN employs a hybrid approach combining differential expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle, using trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and demonstrates low experimental variability with a standard deviation that is reduced by 1.58 to 7.30 percents compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN have been validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The proposed model presents an ability to uncover molecular oncogenesis mechanisms by detecting phosphoinositide-binding substances and regulating sphingolipid cellular processes. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability that has the potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assess the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Methods for Bias Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22569v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the critical role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in data preparation for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems, with a particular focus on addressing and mitigating biases. We present a comparative analysis of three distinct methods for bias mitigation: data sparsification, feature modification, and synthetic data augmentation. Through experimental analysis using the german credit dataset, we evaluate these approaches using multiple fairness metrics, including statistical parity, equality of opportunity, and false positive rates. Our research demonstrates that while all methods improve fairness metrics compared to the original dataset, stratified sampling and synthetic data augmentation using GraphSAGE prove particularly effective in balancing demographic representation while maintaining model performance. The results provide practical insights for developing more equitable AI systems while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |
