| **[TADACap: Time-series Adaptive Domain-Aware Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11441v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image captioning has gained significant attention, the potential of captioning time-series images, prevalent in areas like finance and healthcare, remains largely untapped. Existing time-series captioning methods typically offer generic, domain-agnostic descriptions of time-series shapes and struggle to adapt to new domains without substantial retraining. To address these limitations, we introduce TADACap, a retrieval-based framework to generate domain-aware captions for time-series images, capable of adapting to new domains without retraining. Building on TADACap, we propose a novel retrieval strategy that retrieves diverse image-caption pairs from a target domain database, namely TADACap-diverse. We benchmarked TADACap-diverse against state-of-the-art methods and ablation variants. TADACap-diverse demonstrates comparable semantic accuracy while requiring significantly less annotation effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICAIF 2024</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Aware Attention-LSTM for PM$_{2.5}$ Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24043v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the accuracy and robustness of PM$_{2.5}$ concentration forecasting, this paper introduces FALNet, a Frequency-Aware LSTM Network that integrates frequency-domain decomposition, temporal modeling, and attention-based refinement. The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Part Forecasting for Time-Shifted Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11194v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Katz, Savage, and Brusch propose a two-part forecasting method for sectors where event timing differs from recording time. They treat forecasting as a time-shift operation, using univariate time series for total bookings and a Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average (B-DARMA) model to allocate bookings across trip dates based on lead time. Analysis of Airbnb data shows that this approach is interpretable, flexible, and potentially more accurate for forecasting demand across multiple time axes.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-SHAP for time series: An approach to high-level temporal explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11159v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in domains such as energy forecasting, healthcare, and industry. Using AI systems, some tasks within these domains can be efficiently handled. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase the reliability of AI solutions by explaining model reasoning. For time series, many XAI methods provide point- or sequence-based attribution maps. These methods explain model reasoning in terms of low-level patterns. However, they do not capture high-level patterns that may also influence model reasoning. We propose a concept-based method to provide explanations in terms of these high-level patterns. In this paper, we present C-SHAP for time series, an approach which determines the contribution of concepts to a model outcome. We provide a general definition of C-SHAP and present an example implementation using time series decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology through a use case from the energy domain.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Using Time Structure to Estimate Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11076v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist several approaches for estimating causal effects in time series when latent confounding is present. Many of these approaches rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative controls or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in certain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating direct (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup which does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series. This approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving certain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model parameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called full time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely solvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct causal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under which the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus, under which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical experiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages main paper, 25 pages Appendix, 50 pages in total, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ODEs are a prominent branch of methods designed to capture the temporal evolution of complex time-stamped data. Their idea is to solve an ODE with Neural Network-defined dynamics, which take the immediate parameters of the observed system into account. However, larger integration intervals cause instability, which forces most modern methods to normalize time to $[0, 1]$. We provably stabilize these models by introducing an adaptive negative feedback mechanism. This modification allows for longer integration, which in turn implies higher expressiveness, mirroring the behaviour of increasing depth in conventional Neural Networks.Additionally, it provides intriguing theoretical properties: forgetfulness and missing-value robustness. For three open datasets, our method obtains up to 20\% improvements in downstream quality if compared to existing baselines, including State Space Models and Neural~CDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-learning For Few-Shot Time Series Crop Type Classification: A Benchmark On The EuroCropsML Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11022v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial imbalances in crop type data pose significant challenges for accurate classification in remote sensing applications. Algorithms aiming at transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce tasks have thus surged in popularity. However, despite their effectiveness in previous evaluations, their performance in challenging real-world applications is unclear and needs to be evaluated. This study benchmarks transfer learning and several meta-learning algorithms, including (First-Order) Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ((FO)-MAML), Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), and Task-Informed Meta-Learning (TIML), on the real-world EuroCropsML time series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to simpler transfer learning methods when applied to crop type classification tasks in Estonia after pre-training on data from Latvia. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, we find that the transfer of knowledge between geographically disparate regions, such as Estonia and Portugal, poses significant challenges to all investigated algorithms. These insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resource requirements in selecting machine learning methods for real-world crop type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of transferring knowledge between different regions of the Earth. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating transfer and meta-learning methods for crop type classification under real-world conditions. The corresponding code is publicly available at https://github.com/dida-do/eurocrops-meta-learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03751v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based and MLP-based methods have emerged as leading approaches in time series forecasting (TSF). While Transformer-based methods excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexities and tend to overfit. Conversely, MLP-based methods offer computational efficiency and adeptness in modeling temporal dynamics, but they struggle with capturing complex temporal patterns effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner. Complemented by the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) block and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) block, our approach effectively models both temporal and channel dependencies and utilizes autocorrelation to refine multi-scale data integration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our AMD framework not only overcomes the limitations of existing methods but also consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks across various datasets, showcasing superior efficiency.

| **[Bridging Distribution Gaps in Time Series Foundation Model Pretraining with Prototype-Guided Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10900v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across diverse machine-learning domains through large-scale pretraining on large, diverse datasets. However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; 6 figures; to appear in Proceedings of 2025 IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02153v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, conditionally accepted to ICWSM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting from Clinical Textual Time Series: Adaptations of the Encoder and Decoder Language Model Families](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10340v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical case reports encode rich, temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Spectral estimation for high-dimensional linear processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10257v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel estimation procedure for certain spectral distributions associated with a class of high dimensional linear time series. The processes under consideration are of the form $X_t = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \mathbf{A}_\ell Z_{t-\ell}$ with iid innovations $(Z_t)$. The key structural assumption is that the coefficient matrices and the variance of the innovations are simultaneously diagonalizable in a common orthonormal basis. We develop a strategy for estimating the joint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices and the innovation variance by making use of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of appropriately weighted integrals of the sample periodogram. Throughout we work under the asymptotic regime $p,n \to \infty$, such that $p/n\to c \in (0,\infty)$, where $p$ is the dimension and $n$ is the sample size. Under this setting, we first establish a weak limit for the empirical distribution of eigenvalues of the aforementioned integrated sample periodograms. This result is proved using techniques from random matrix theory, in particular the characterization of weak convergence by means of the Stieltjes transform of relevant distributions. We utilize this result to develop an estimator of the joint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices, by minimizing an $L^\kappa$ discrepancy measure, for $\kappa \geq 1$, between the empirical and limiting Stieltjes transforms of the integrated sample periodograms. This is accomplished by assuming that the joint spectral distribution is a discrete mixture of point masses. We also prove consistency of the estimator corresponding to the $L^2$ discrepancy measure. We illustrate the methodology through simulations and an application to stock price data from the S\&P 500 series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Neural Differential Algebraic Equations via Operator Splitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12938v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) describe the temporal evolution of systems that obey both differential and algebraic constraints. Of particular interest are systems that contain implicit relationships between their components, such as conservation relationships. Here, we present an Operator Splitting (OS) numerical integration scheme for learning unknown components of Differential-Algebraic Equations from time-series data. This methodology is built upon the concept of the Universal Differential Equation; that is, a model constructed as a system of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations informed by theory from particular science domains. In this work, we show that the proposed OS-based time-stepping scheme is suitable for relevant system-theoretic data-driven modeling tasks. Presented examples include (i) the inverse problem of tank-manifold dynamics and (ii) discrepancy modeling of a network of pumps, tanks, and pipes. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's robustness to noise and extrapolation ability to (i) learn the behaviors of the system components and their interaction physics and (ii) disambiguate between data trends and mechanistic relationships contained in the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of the article now includes problem statement</p></details> |
| **[Can Competition Enhance the Proficiency of Agents Powered by Large Language Models in the Realm of News-driven Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10210v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agents-based news-driven time series forecasting is considered as a potential paradigm shift in the era of large language models (LLMs). The challenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news events towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess stronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic. However, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement on time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities. Inspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds a competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents' capability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the model's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a fine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering auxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to the findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this framework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective for studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to forecast agricultural production in Maharashtra, India, which utilises annual data from the year 1962 to 2021. Since rainfall plays a major role with respect to the crop yield, we analyze the impact of rainfall on crop yield using four time series models that includes ARIMA, ARIMAX, GARCH-ARIMA and GARCH-ARIMAX. We take advantage of rainfall as an external regressor to examine if it contributes to the performance of the model. 1-step, 2-step, and 3-step ahead forecasts are obtained and the model performance is assessed using MAE and RMSE. The models are able to more accurately predict when using rainfall as a predictor compared to when solely dependant on historical production trends (more improved outcomes are seen in the ARIMAX and GARCH-ARIMAX models). As such, these findings underscore the need for climate-aware forecasting techniques that provide useful information to policymakers and farmers to aid in agricultural planning.</p></details> | Preprint. 14 pages |
| **[Learning-based Observer for Coupled Disturbance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13229v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-precision control for robotic systems is hindered by the low-fidelity dynamical model and external disturbances. Especially, the intricate coupling between internal uncertainties and external disturbances further exacerbates this challenge. This study introduces an effective and convergent algorithm enabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control and learning philosophies. Concretely, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures dependent on system state and external disturbance respectively. A regularized least squares algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix using historical time-series data. Finally, a polynomial disturbance observer is specifically devised to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations and real flight tests. We believe this work can offer a new pathway to integrate learning approaches into control frameworks for addressing longstanding challenges in robotic applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Inferring the Hubble Constant Using Simulated Strongly Lensed Supernovae and Neural Network Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10553v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strongly lensed supernovae are a promising new probe to obtain independent measurements of the Hubble constant (${H_0}$). In this work, we employ simulated gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) to train our machine learning (ML) pipeline to constrain $H_0$. We simulate image time-series of glSNIa, as observed with the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that we employ for training an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The outputs of this ensemble network are combined with a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to quantify the uncertainties on the network predictions and infer full posteriors for the $H_0$ estimates. We illustrate that the combination of multiple glSN systems enhances constraint precision, providing a $4.4\%$ estimate of $H_0$ based on 100 simulated systems, which is in agreement with the ground truth. This research highlights the potential of leveraging the capabilities of ML with glSNe systems to obtain a pipeline capable of fast and automated $H_0$ measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Physical Scales Matter: The Role of Receptive Fields and Advection in Satellite-Based Thunderstorm Nowcasting with Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09994v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long lead times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired lead time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on lead time and wind speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h lead time. We confirm that generally advection becomes gradually more important with longer lead times and higher wind speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML based forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[AimTS: Augmented Series and Image Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09993v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification (TSC) is an important task in time series analysis. Existing TSC methods mainly train on each single domain separately, suffering from a degradation in accuracy when the samples for training are insufficient in certain domains. The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm provides a promising direction for solving this problem. However, time series from different domains are substantially divergent, which challenges the effective pre-training on multi-source data and the generalization ability of pre-trained models. To handle this issue, we introduce Augmented Series and Image Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification (AimTS), a pre-training framework that learns generalizable representations from multi-source time series data. We propose a two-level prototype-based contrastive learning method to effectively utilize various augmentations in multi-source pre-training, which learns representations for TSC that can be generalized to different domains. In addition, considering augmentations within the single time series modality are insufficient to fully address classification problems with distribution shift, we introduce the image modality to supplement structural information and establish a series-image contrastive learning to improve the generalization of the learned representations for TSC tasks. Extensive experiments show that after multi-source pre-training, AimTS achieves good generalization performance, enabling efficient learning and even few-shot learning on various downstream TSC datasets.</p></details> |  |

These constraints significantly limit the performance of sensing intelligence in IoT applications, as the heterogeneity and the non-interpretability of time-series signals result in abundant unimodal data but scarce high-quality multimodal pairs. This paper proposes InfoMAE, a cross-modal alignment framework that tackles the challenge of multimodal pair efficiency under the SSL setting by facilitating efficient cross-modal alignment of pretrained unimodal representations. InfoMAE achieves \textit{efficient cross-modal alignment} with \textit{limited data pairs} through a novel information theory-inspired formulation that simultaneously addresses distribution-level and instance-level alignment. Extensive experiments on two real-world IoT applications are performed to evaluate InfoMAE's pairing efficiency to bridge pretrained unimodal models into a cohesive joint multimodal model. InfoMAE enhances downstream multimodal tasks by over 60% with significantly improved multimodal pairing efficiency. It also improves unimodal task accuracy by an average of 22%.</p></details> |  |

While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-based approaches have shown promise in this domain, existing meta task construction strategies often lead to suboptimal performance, especially when dealing with highly turbulent financial time series. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task construction method that leverages learned embeddings for more effective meta-learning in the zero-shot setting. Specifically, we construct two complementary types of meta-tasks based on the learned embeddings: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. To capture diverse fine-grained patterns, we apply stochastic projection matrices to the learned embeddings and use clustering algorithm to form the tasks. Additionally, to improve generalization capabilities, we employ hard task mining strategies and leverage inter-cluster tasks to identify invariant patterns across different time series. Extensive experiments on the real world financial dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, showing better generalization ability in the zero-shot scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ordinary Least Squares as an Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09663v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replacing ARDL? Introducing the NSB-ARDL Model for Structural and Asymmetric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09646v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the NSB-ARDL (Nonlinear Structural Break Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model, a novel econometric framework designed to capture asymmetric and nonlinear dynamics in macroeconomic time series. Traditional ARDL models, while widely used for estimating short- and long-run relationships, rely on assumptions of linearity and symmetry that may overlook critical structural features in real-world data. The NSB-ARDL model overcomes these limitations by decomposing explanatory variables into cumulative positive and negative partial sums, enabling the identification of both short- and long-term asymmetries. Monte Carlo simulations show that NSB-ARDL consistently outperforms conventional ARDL models in terms of forecasting accuracy when asymmetric responses are present in the data-generating process. An empirical application to South Korea's CO2 emissions demonstrates the model's practical advantages, yielding a better in-sample fit and more interpretable long-run coefficients. These findings highlight the NSB-ARDL model as a structurally robust and forecasting-efficient alternative for analyzing nonlinear macroeconomic phenomena.</p></details> | draft |
| **[MADLLM: Multivariate Anomaly Detection via Pre-trained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09504v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to address anomaly detection tasks, the multivariate time series (MTS) modality of anomaly detection does not align with the text modality of LLMs. Existing methods simply transform the MTS data into multiple univariate time series sequences, which can cause many problems. This paper introduces MADLLM, a novel multivariate anomaly detection method via pre-trained LLMs. We design a new triple encoding technique to align the MTS modality with the text modality of LLMs. Specifically, this technique integrates the traditional patch embedding method with two novel embedding approaches: Skip Embedding, which alters the order of patch processing in traditional methods to help LLMs retain knowledge of previous features, and Feature Embedding, which leverages contrastive learning to allow the model to better understand the correlations between different features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various public anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo 2025 (ICME 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Ensemble-Enhanced Graph Autoencoder with GAT and Transformer-Based Encoders for Robust Fault Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09427v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault classification in industrial machinery is vital for enhancing reliability and reducing downtime, yet it remains challenging due to the variability of vibration patterns across diverse operating conditions. This study introduces a novel graph-based framework for fault classification, converting time-series vibration data from machinery operating at varying horsepower levels into a graph representation. We utilize Shannon's entropy to determine the optimal window size for data segmentation, ensuring each segment captures significant temporal patterns, and employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to define graph edges based on segment similarity. A Graph Auto Encoder (GAE) with a deep graph transformer encoder, decoder, and ensemble classifier is developed to learn latent graph representations and classify faults across various categories. The GAE's performance is evaluated on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, with cross-dataset generalization assessed on the HUST dataset. Results show that GAE achieves a mean F1-score of 0.99 on the CWRU dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models-CNN, LSTM, RNN, GRU, and Bi-LSTM (F1-scores: 0.94-0.97, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for Bi-LSTM: p < 0.05) -- particularly in challenging classes (e.g., Class 8: 0.99 vs. 0.71 for Bi-LSTM). Visualization of dataset characteristics reveals that datasets with amplified vibration patterns and diverse fault dynamics enhance generalization. This framework provides a robust solution for fault diagnosis under varying conditions, offering insights into dataset impacts on model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, AGC systems' reliance on communicated measurements exposes them to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which can compromise the overall system stability. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based detection framework that identifies FDIAs and determines the compromised measurements. The approach utilizes an ML model trained offline to accurately detect attacks and classify the manipulated signals based on a comprehensive set of statistical and time-series features extracted from AGC measurements before and after disturbances. For the proposed approach, we compare the performance of several powerful ML algorithms. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting FDIAs while maintaining a low false alarm rate, with an F1-score of up to 99.98%, outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE</p></details> |

Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression (OHSGPR), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SGPR inducing points to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate our method on time series regression tasks, showing that it outperforms the existing online GP method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Remaining Useful Life Prediction with Scarce Time Series Data: Regression under Indirect Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09206v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised time series prediction relies on directly measured target variables, but real-world use cases such as predicting remaining useful life (RUL) involve indirect supervision, where the target variable is labeled as a function of another dependent variable. Trending temporal regression techniques rely on sequential time series inputs to capture temporal patterns, requiring interpolation when dealing with sparsely and irregularly sampled covariates along the timeline. However, interpolation can introduce significant biases, particularly with highly scarce data. In this paper, we address the RUL prediction problem with data scarcity as time series regression under indirect supervision. We introduce a unified framework called parameterized static regression, which takes single data points as inputs for regression of target values, inherently handling data scarcity without requiring interpolation. The time dependency under indirect supervision is captured via a parametrical rectification (PR) process, approximating a parametric function during inference with historical posteriori estimates, following the same underlying distribution used for labeling during training. Additionally, we propose a novel batch training technique for tasks in indirect supervision to prevent overfitting and enhance efficiency. We evaluate our model on public benchmarks for RUL prediction with simulated data scarcity. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in prediction accuracy when dealing with highly scarce time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning-Driven Multi-Vessel Association: Fusing Multimodal Data for Maritime Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09197v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring maritime safety and optimizing traffic management in increasingly crowded and complex waterways require effective waterway monitoring. However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repetitive Contrastive Learning Enhances Mamba's Selectivity in Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09185v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperlocal disaster damage assessment using bi-temporal street-view imagery and pre-trained vision models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09066v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street-view images offer unique advantages for disaster damage estimation as they capture impacts from a visual perspective and provide detailed, on-the-ground insights. Despite several investigations attempting to analyze street-view images for damage estimation, they mainly focus on post-disaster images. The potential of time-series street-view images remains underexplored. Pre-disaster images provide valuable benchmarks for accurate damage estimations at building and street levels. These images could aid annotators in objectively labeling post-disaster impacts, improving the reliability of labeled data sets for model training, and potentially enhancing the model performance in damage evaluation. The goal of this study is to estimate hyperlocal, on-the-ground disaster damages using bi-temporal street-view images and advanced pre-trained vision models. Street-view images before and after 2024 Hurricane Milton in Horseshoe Beach, Florida, were collected for experiments. The objectives are: (1) to assess the performance gains of incorporating pre-disaster street-view images as a no-damage category in fine-tuning pre-trained models, including Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt, for damage level classification; (2) to design and evaluate a dual-channel algorithm that reads pair-wise pre- and post-disaster street-view images for hyperlocal damage assessment. The results indicate that incorporating pre-disaster street-view images and employing a dual-channel processing framework can significantly enhance damage assessment accuracy. The accuracy improves from 66.14% with the Swin Transformer baseline to 77.11% with the dual-channel Feature-Fusion ConvNeXt model. This research enables rapid, operational damage assessments at hyperlocal spatial resolutions, providing valuable insights to support effective decision-making in disaster management and resilience planning.</p></details> | 27 pages,9 figures |
| **[Bidirectional Linear Recurrent Models for Sequence-Level Multisource Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08964v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling is a critical yet challenging task with wide-ranging applications, especially in time series forecasting for domains like weather prediction, temperature monitoring, and energy load forecasting. Transformers, with their attention mechanism, have emerged as state-of-the-art due to their efficient parallel training, but they suffer from quadratic time complexity, limiting their scalability for long sequences. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer linear time complexity, spurring renewed interest in linear RNNs for more computationally efficient sequence modeling. In this work, we introduce BLUR (Bidirectional Linear Unit for Recurrent network), which uses forward and backward linear recurrent units (LRUs) to capture both past and future dependencies with high computational efficiency. BLUR maintains the linear time complexity of traditional RNNs, while enabling fast parallel training through LRUs. Furthermore, it offers provably stable training and strong approximation capabilities, making it highly effective for modeling long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments on sequential image and time series datasets reveal that BLUR not only surpasses transformers and traditional RNNs in accuracy but also significantly reduces computational costs, making it particularly suitable for real-world forecasting tasks.

To this end, we consider an at-most-one-change model and approximate the unknown (auto-)regression function by a neuronal network with one hidden layer. It is shown that the test has asymptotic power one for a wide range of alternatives not restricted to changes in the mean of the time series. Furthermore, we prove that the corresponding estimator converges to the true change point with the optimal rate OP (1/n) and derive the asymptotic distribution. Some simulations illustrate the behavior of the estimator with a special focus on the misspecified case, where the true regression function is not given by a neuronal network. Finally, we apply the estimator to some financial data.</p></details> |  |

The model consists of two tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track provides additional information to the main track, extracted from representative series. This information as well as information extracted from exogenous variables is dynamically adjusted to the individual series forecasted by the main track. The RNN stacked architecture with hierarchical dilations, incorporating recently developed attentive dilated recurrent cells, allows the model to capture short and long-term dependencies across time series and dynamically weight input information. The model generates both point daily forecasts and predictive intervals for one-day, one-week and four-week horizons. We apply our model to forecast prices of 15 cryptocurrencies based on 17 input variables and compare its performance with that of comparative models, including both statistical and ML ones.</p></details> |  |

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Universal Domain Adaptation on Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11217v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, even when their classes are not fully shared. Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which remains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class samples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection often results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value is typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits the ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability metrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to misclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based method that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our method also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of the detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to reduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds. Finally, we rely on a Fourier transform-based layer inspired by the Fourier Neural Operator for better TS representation. Experiments on TS benchmarks demonstrate the discriminability, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance of UniJDOT.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

These CA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed relationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential aspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance, walking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but differ in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related. Consequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these inherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels typically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is unavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this limitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity labels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that preserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach encodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated activity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings. During training, SEAL aligns the sensor data representations with their corresponding activity/context label embeddings in a shared embedding space. At inference time, SEAL performs a similarity search, returning the CA-HAR label with the embedding representation closest to the input data. Although LMs have been widely explored in other domains, surprisingly, their potential in CA-HAR has been underexplored, making our approach a novel contribution to the field. Our research opens up new possibilities for integrating more advanced LMs into CA-HAR tasks.</p></details> | Percom 2025 |

However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection.

| **[Event Signal Filtering via Probability Flux Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07503v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Events offer a novel paradigm for capturing scene dynamics via asynchronous sensing, but their inherent randomness often leads to degraded signal quality. Event signal filtering is thus essential for enhancing fidelity by reducing this internal randomness and ensuring consistent outputs across diverse acquisition conditions. Unlike traditional time series that rely on fixed temporal sampling to capture steady-state behaviors, events encode transient dynamics through polarity and event intervals, making signal modeling significantly more complex. To address this, the theoretical foundation of event generation is revisited through the lens of diffusion processes. The state and process information within events is modeled as continuous probability flux at threshold boundaries of the underlying irradiance diffusion. Building on this insight, a generative, online filtering framework called Event Density Flow Filter (EDFilter) is introduced. EDFilter estimates event correlation by reconstructing the continuous probability flux from discrete events using nonparametric kernel smoothing, and then resamples filtered events from this flux. To optimize fidelity over time, spatial and temporal kernels are employed in a time-varying optimization framework. A fast recursive solver with O(1) complexity is proposed, leveraging state-space models and lookup tables for efficient likelihood computation. Furthermore, a new real-world benchmark Rotary Event Dataset (RED) is released, offering microsecond-level ground truth irradiance for full-reference event filtering evaluation. Extensive experiments validate EDFilter's performance across tasks like event filtering, super-resolution, and direct event-based blob tracking. Significant gains in downstream applications such as SLAM and video reconstruction underscore its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This problem has received considerable attention in low-dimensional settings, with both Bayesian and frequentist methods used extensively for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm is a particularly popular strategy for parameter estimation in low-dimensional settings, although the statistical properties of the resulting estimates have not been well understood. Furthermore, its extension to high-dimensional time series has proved challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose an approximate EM algorithm for Markov-switching VAR models that leads to efficient computation and also facilitates the investigation of asymptotic properties of the resulting parameter estimates. We establish the consistency of the proposed EM algorithm in high dimensions and investigate its performance via simulation studies. We also demonstrate the algorithm by analyzing a brain electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded on a patient experiencing epileptic seizure.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMAD: AutoMasked Attention for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06643v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach.

In addition to the most common task of weather forecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the modality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity prediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and confidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the artificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper, we first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M, which aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather events data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a unified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also propose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive performance in weather forecasting, thunderstorm alerts, and crop segmentation tasks in the proposed ClimateBench-M. The data and code of ClimateBench-M are publicly available at https://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/ClimateBench-M.</p></details> | Preprint, 29 pages |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07360v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a class of dynamical time series models for continuous random variables taking values in $(0,1)$ based on the Unit-Lindley distribution. The models pertaining to the proposed class are observation-driven ones for which, conditionally on a set of covariates, the random component is modeled by a Unit-Lindley distribution. The systematic component aims at modeling the conditional mean through a dynamical structure resembling the classical ARMA models. Parameter estimation in conducted using partial maximum likelihood, for which an asymptotic theory is available. Based on asymptotic results, the construction of confidence intervals, hypotheses testing, model selection, and forecasting can be carried on. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed partial maximum likelihood approach. Finally, an application considering forecasting of the proportion of net electricity generated by conventional hydroelectric power in the United States is presented. The application show the versatility of the proposed method compared to other benchmarks models in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.18645</p></details> |

We have used spectral and bispectral information obtained from the data, by using spectral and bispectral means with different weight functions that will give us varying insights into the temporal patterns of the stocks. In particular, the higher order polyspectral means can provide significantly more information than what we can gather from power spectra, and can also unveil nonlinear trends in a time series. Through rigorous analysis, we identify five distinctive clusters, uncovering nuanced market structures. Notably, one cluster emerges as that of a conglomerate powerhouse, featuring ADANI, BIRLA, TATA, and unexpectedly, government-owned bank SBI. Another cluster spotlights the IT sector with WIPRO and TCS, while a third combines private banks, government entities, and RELIANCE. The final cluster comprises publicly traded companies with dispersed ownership. Such clustering of stocks sheds light on intricate financial relationships within the stock market, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts navigating the dynamic landscape of the Indian stock market.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Discover Data</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Temporal Dropout in Earth Observation Time Series for Regression Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06915v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing instances in time series data impose a significant challenge to deep learning models, particularly in regression tasks. In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Quantized symbolic time series approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15209v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series. Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors. An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODEStream: A Buffer-Free Online Learning Framework with ODE-based Adaptor for Streaming Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07413v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the challenges of irregularity and concept drift in streaming time series is crucial for real-world predictive modelling. Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer to capture temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change over time, facilitating direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baseline models, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change. The implementation of ODEStream is available at: https://github.com/FtoonAbushaqra/ODEStream.git.</p></details> |  |

Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15787v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[From Text to Time? Rethinking the Effectiveness of the Large Language Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08818v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as the backbone for time series prediction has recently gained significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of LLM backbones in this domain remains a topic of debate. Based on thorough empirical analyses, we observe that training and testing LLM-based models on small datasets often leads to the Encoder and Decoder becoming overly adapted to the dataset, thereby obscuring the true predictive capabilities of the LLM backbone. To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs in time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with identical architectures but different pre-training strategies. Thereby, large-scale pre-training allows us to create unbiased Encoder and Decoder components tailored to the LLM backbone. Through controlled experiments, we evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot prediction performance of the LLM, offering insights into its capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that although the LLM backbone demonstrates some promise, its forecasting performance is limited.

| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather and Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by variable renewable energy technologies. However, renewable electricity generation from wind and solar technologies, as well as electricity demand, varies with the weather. This work addresses the problem of determining optimal capacities for renewable technologies in energy systems that ensure sufficient electricity supply when dealing with multi-year time-series data. An iterative algorithm is proposed that starts by optimising an arbitrary starting time-series, followed by adding additional constraints and reoptimising the modified optimisation problem until sufficient energy supply is provided for all time--series, i.e. the solution is robust to weather and demand variations. This is evaluated in a computational study on a German energy system model.The results show that the iterative algorithm finds robust solutions for an increase of 2-2.5% in total annual cost for a simplified model in gurobipy and 2.9% for a model built in the model framework ETHOS.FINE. Testing the feasibility for non robust solutions showed that supply gaps occurred in at least some of the remaining years. Based on the results of this work, ensuring feasibility within an energy system model for multiple time-series boils down to two factors: ensuring sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of high demand combined with low electricity generation from wind and photovoltaic, and enforcing sufficient total annual electricity generation. Our proposed open source iterative algorithm is able to ensure this. For general modelling, it is recommended to check for systematic effects of different years' time--series on energy system models especially for wind, but also for photovoltaics, include dark lull and cold period effects on generation and demand in time--series, and assess the feasibility of energy system models using different time-series.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLaSP: Learning Concepts for Time-Series Signals from Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08397v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.</p></details> |  |

Fuzzy based methods are getting more popular, while the engineers deal with more daily life tasks. This paper presents a new Python toolkit for Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2FLS). Developing software tools is an important issue for facilitating the practical use of theoretical results. There are limited tools for implementing IT2FLSs in Python. The developed PyIT2FLS is providing a set of tools for fast and easy modeling of fuzzy systems. This paper includes a brief description of how developed toolkit can be used. Also, three examples are given showing the usage of the developed toolkit for simulating IT2FLSs. First, a simple rule-based system is developed and it's codes are presented in the paper. The second example is the prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series using IT2FLS. In this example, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for determining system parameters while minimizing the mean square error. In the last example, an IT2FPID is designed and used for controlling a linear time-delay system. The code for the examples are available on toolkit's GitHub page: https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS. The simulations and their results confirm the ability of the developed toolkit to be used in a wide range of the applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been published in SoftwareX, Volume 30, May 2025, 102146. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2025.102146</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Effectiveness and Interpretability of Texts in LLM-based Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08808v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to time series forecasting tasks, leveraging pre-trained language models as the backbone and incorporating textual data to purportedly enhance the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs for time series. However, are these texts really helpful for interpretation? This study seeks to investigate the actual efficacy and interpretability of such textual incorporations. Through a series of empirical experiments on textual prompts and textual prototypes, our findings reveal that the misalignment between two modalities exists, and the textual information does not significantly improve time series forecasting performance in many cases. Furthermore, visualization analysis indicates that the textual representations learned by existing frameworks lack sufficient interpretability when applied to time series data. We further propose a novel metric named Semantic Matching Index (SMI) to better evaluate the matching degree between time series and texts during our post hoc interpretability investigation. Our analysis reveals the misalignment and limited interpretability of texts in current time-series LLMs, and we hope this study can raise awareness of the interpretability of texts for time series.

| **[WaveHiTS: Wavelet-Enhanced Hierarchical Time Series Modeling for Wind Direction Nowcasting in Eastern Inner Mongolia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06532v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wind direction forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing wind energy production, but faces significant challenges due to the circular nature of directional data, error accumulation in multi-step forecasting, and complex meteorological interactions. This paper presents a novel model, WaveHiTS, which integrates wavelet transform with Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes wind direction into U-V components, applies wavelet transform to capture multi-scale frequency patterns, and utilizes a hierarchical structure to model temporal dependencies at multiple scales, effectively mitigating error propagation. Experiments conducted on real-world meteorological data from Inner Mongolia, China demonstrate that WaveHiTS significantly outperforms deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU), transformer-based approaches (TFT, Informer, iTransformer), and hybrid models (EMD-LSTM). The proposed model achieves RMSE values of approximately 19.2{\deg}-19.4{\deg} compared to 56{\deg}-64{\deg} for deep learning recurrent models, maintaining consistent accuracy across all forecasting steps up to 60 minutes ahead. Moreover, WaveHiTS demonstrates superior robustness with vector correlation coefficients (VCC) of 0.985-0.987 and hit rates of 88.5%-90.1%, substantially outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirm that each component-wavelet transform, hierarchical structure, and U-V decomposition-contributes meaningfully to overall performance. These improvements in wind direction nowcasting have significant implications for enhancing wind turbine yaw control efficiency and grid integration of wind energy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSP-OCS: A Time-Series Prediction for Optimal Camera Selection in Multi-Viewpoint Surgical Video Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06527v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recording the open surgery process is essential for educational and medical evaluation purposes; however, traditional single-camera methods often face challenges such as occlusions caused by the surgeon's head and body, as well as limitations due to fixed camera angles, which reduce comprehensibility of the video content. This study addresses these limitations by employing a multi-viewpoint camera recording system, capturing the surgical procedure from six different angles to mitigate occlusions. We propose a fully supervised learning-based time series prediction method to choose the best shot sequences from multiple simultaneously recorded video streams, ensuring optimal viewpoints at each moment. Our time series prediction model forecasts future camera selections by extracting and fusing visual and semantic features from surgical videos using pre-trained models. These features are processed by a temporal prediction network with TimeBlocks to capture sequential dependencies. A linear embedding layer reduces dimensionality, and a Softmax classifier selects the optimal camera view based on the highest probability. In our experiments, we created five groups of open thyroidectomy videos, each with simultaneous recordings from six different angles. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy compared to traditional supervised methods, even when predicting over longer time horizons. Furthermore, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art time series prediction techniques on our dataset. This manuscript makes a unique contribution by presenting an innovative framework that advances surgical video analysis techniques, with significant implications for improving surgical education and patient safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[A temporal scale transformer framework for precise remaining useful life prediction in fuel cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08803v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In exploring Predictive Health Management (PHM) strategies for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), the Transformer model, widely used in data-driven approaches, excels in many fields but struggles with time series analysis due to its self-attention mechanism, which yields a complexity of the input sequence squared and low computational efficiency. It also faces challenges in capturing both global long-term dependencies and local details effectively. To tackle this, we propose the Temporal Scale Transformer (TSTransformer), an enhanced version of the inverted Transformer (iTransformer). Unlike traditional Transformers that treat each timestep as an input token, TSTransformer maps sequences of varying lengths into tokens at different stages for inter-sequence modeling, using attention to capture multivariate correlations and feed-forward networks (FFN) to encode sequence representations. By integrating a one-dimensional convolutional layer into the multivariate attention for multi-level scaling of K and V matrices, it improves local feature extraction, captures temporal scale characteristics, and reduces token count and computational costs. Experiments comparing TSTransformer with models like Long Short-Term Memory, iTransformer, and Transformer demonstrate its potential as a powerful tool for advancing PHM in renewable energy, effectively addressing the limitations of pure Transformer models in data-driven time series tasks.</p></details> | 7 figs, 10 pages |

A significant challenge in FTS consists of accurately capturing the time-dependence structure, especially with the presence of time-varying covariates. When analyzing time series with time-varying statistical properties, locally stationary time series (LSTS) provide a robust framework that allows smooth changes in mean and variance over time. This work investigates Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimation procedure for the conditional distribution of locally stationary functional time series (LSFTS), where the covariates reside in a semi-metric space endowed with a semi-metric. Under small ball probability and mixing condition, we establish convergence rates of NW estimator for LSFTS with respect to Wasserstein distance. The finite-sample performances of the model and the estimation method are illustrated through extensive numerical experiments both on functional simulated and real data.</p></details> |  |

Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are not available at every forecast cycle. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational ATCF, it relies only on geostationary IR satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AMS journal Weather and Forecasting.

This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |
| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |

In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to forecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs). LTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against traditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, demonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series models, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS prediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring significantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze-Guided Learning: Avoiding Shortcut Bias in Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05583v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by human visual attention, deep neural networks have widely adopted attention mechanisms to learn locally discriminative attributes for challenging visual classification tasks. However, existing approaches primarily emphasize the representation of such features while neglecting their precise localization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases. This limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on transfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of leveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained attributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and high-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Gaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence gaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention on distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through cross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with machine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate localization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues significantly enhance classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, URL: https://szyyjl.github.io/eye_tracking_data.github.io/</p></details> |

This is influenced by numerous meteorological factors, geographical positioning, and photovoltaic cell properties, posing significant challenges to forecasting accuracy and grid stability. Our study introduces a suite of solutions centered around hybrid quantum neural networks designed to tackle these complexities. The first proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory, surpasses all tested models by achieving mean absolute errors and mean squared errors that are more than 40% lower. The second proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence neural network, once trained, predicts photovoltaic power with 16% lower mean absolute error for arbitrary time intervals without the need for prior meteorological data, highlighting its versatility. Moreover, our hybrid models perform better even when trained on limited datasets, underlining their potential utility in data-scarce scenarios. These findings represent progress towards resolving time series prediction challenges in energy forecasting through hybrid quantum models, showcasing the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in catalyzing the renewable energy transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our materials are available at: https://dat-nguyenvn.github.io/WildLive/</p></details> |  |

We propose a deep learning framework that combines three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, bidirectional long short-term memory layers, and multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Using daily data on 14 exchange-traded funds from 2017 through 2023, we find that our model reduces Euclidean and Frobenius distance metrics by up to 20\% relative to classical benchmarks (e.g., shrinkage and GARCH approaches) and remains robust across distinct market regimes. Our portfolio experiments demonstrate significant economic value through lower volatility and moderate turnover. These findings highlight the potential of advanced deep learning architectures to improve medium-term covariance forecasts, offering practical benefits for institutional investors and risk managers.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterAnimate: Taming Region-aware Diffusion Model for Realistic Human Interaction Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10905v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation research has focused heavily on isolated actions, leaving interactive motions-such as hand-face interactions-largely unexamined. These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.</p></details> | under preview |
| **[Rainy: Unlocking Satellite Calibration for Deep Learning in Precipitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10776v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation plays a critical role in the Earth's hydrological cycle, directly affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and water resource management. Accurate precipitation estimation and prediction are crucial for understanding climate dynamics, disaster preparedness, and environmental monitoring. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing attention in quantitative remote sensing (QRS), enabling more advanced data analysis and improving precipitation estimation accuracy. Although traditional methods have been widely used for precipitation estimation, they face limitations due to the difficulty of data acquisition and the challenge of capturing complex feature relationships. Furthermore, the lack of standardized multi-source satellite datasets, and in most cases, the exclusive reliance on station data, significantly hinders the effective application of advanced AI models. To address these challenges, we propose the Rainy dataset, a multi-source spatio-temporal dataset that integrates pure satellite data with station data, and propose Taper Loss, designed to fill the gap in tasks where only in-situ data is available without area-wide support. The Rainy dataset supports five main tasks: (1) satellite calibration, (2) precipitation event prediction, (3) precipitation level prediction, (4) spatiotemporal prediction, and (5) precipitation downscaling. For each task, we selected benchmark models and evaluation metrics to provide valuable references for researchers. Using precipitation as an example, the Rainy dataset and Taper Loss demonstrate the seamless collaboration between QRS and computer vision, offering data support for AI for Science in the field of QRS and providing valuable insights for interdisciplinary collaboration and integration.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption remains limited among scientists outside the deep learning community due to storage, compute, and technical expertise barriers. To address this, we introduce Climplicit, a spatio-temporal geolocation encoder pretrained to generate implicit climatic representations anywhere on Earth. By bypassing the need to download raw climatic rasters and train feature extractors, our model uses x3500 less disk space and significantly reduces computational needs for downstream tasks. We evaluate our Climplicit embeddings on biomes classification, species distribution modeling, and plant trait regression. We find that single-layer probing our Climplicit embeddings consistently performs better or on par with training a model from scratch on downstream tasks and overall better than alternative geolocation encoding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Personalised 3D+t Mesh Generative Model for Unveiling Normal Heart Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13825v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the structure and motion of the heart is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global death. There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, that are influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling the normal patterns of shape and motion, as well as understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a novel conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of cardiac shape and motion patterns. MeshHeart is capable of generating 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences, taking into account clinical factors such as age, sex, weight and height. To model the high-dimensional and complex spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, followed by a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a novel distance metric termed latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern in the latent space. In experiments using a large dataset of 38,309 subjects, MeshHeart demonstrates a high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Features defined in the latent space are highly discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas the latent delta exhibits strong correlation with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The codes and models of this study will be released to benefit further research on digital heart modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[GeOT: A spatially explicit framework for evaluating spatio-temporal predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11709v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When predicting observations across space and time, the spatial layout of errors impacts a model's real-world utility. For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training. All code is available at https://github.com/mie-lab/geospatialOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTFSal: Audio-Visual Dynamic Token Fusion for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10070v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual saliency prediction aims to mimic human visual attention by identifying salient regions in videos through the integration of both visual and auditory information. Although visual-only approaches have significantly advanced, effectively incorporating auditory cues remains challenging due to complex spatio-temporal interactions and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Token Fusion Saliency (DFTSal), a novel audio-visual saliency prediction framework designed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency. Our approach features a multi-scale visual encoder equipped with two novel modules: the Learnable Token Enhancement Block (LTEB), which adaptively weights tokens to emphasize crucial saliency cues, and the Dynamic Learnable Token Fusion Block (DLTFB), which employs a shifting operation to reorganize and merge features, effectively capturing long-range dependencies and detailed spatial information. In parallel, an audio branch processes raw audio signals to extract meaningful auditory features. Both visual and audio features are integrated using our Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Block (AMFB), which employs local, global, and adaptive fusion streams for precise cross-modal fusion. The resulting fused features are processed by a hierarchical multi-decoder structure, producing accurate saliency maps. Extensive evaluations on six audio-visual benchmarks demonstrate that DFTSal achieves SOTA performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Accurate air quality prediction is a complex multivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal patterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and particularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and chemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of atmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive meteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic interdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models air quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities, integrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to capture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\% compared to the state-of-the-art model.

| **[Advancing RFI-Detection in Radio Astronomy with Liquid State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09796v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from anthropogenic radio sources poses significant challenges to current and future radio telescopes. Contemporary approaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem on radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle this task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most difficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated high accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements of modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to RFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source data. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking neural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture and neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three increasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head, providing a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond conventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation. We train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection. Our model achieves a per-pixel accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.743, demonstrating competitive performance on this highly challenging task. This work expands the sophistication of SNN techniques and architectures applied to RFI-detection, and highlights the effectiveness of LSMs in handling fine-grained, complex, spatio-temporal signal-processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

This measurement and communication setup is well-suited for operating large-scale control systems and, at the same time, introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries through (i) manipulation of measurements, (ii) manipulation of time-stamps, (iii) elimination of measurements, (iv) generation of completely new false measurements, or a combination of these attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we propose a decentralized estimation algorithm in which each sensor maintains its local state estimate asynchronously based on its measurements. The local states are synchronized through time prediction and fused after time-stamp alignment. In the absence of attacks, state estimates are proven to recover the optimal Kalman estimates by solving a weighted least square problem. In the presence of attacks, solving this weighted least square problem with the aid of $\ell_1$ regularization provides secure state estimates with uniformly bounded error under an observability redundancy assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and 6 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.17514</p></details> |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[End-to-end Open-vocabulary Video Visual Relationship Detection using Multi-modal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12499v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to expand video visual relationship detection beyond annotated categories by detecting unseen relationships between both seen and unseen objects in videos. Existing methods usually use trajectory detectors trained on closed datasets to detect object trajectories, and then feed these trajectories into large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to achieve open-vocabulary classification. Such heavy dependence on the pre-trained trajectory detectors limits their ability to generalize to novel object categories, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose to unify object trajectory detection and relationship classification into an end-to-end open-vocabulary framework. Under this framework, we propose a relationship-aware open-vocabulary trajectory detector. It primarily consists of a query-based Transformer decoder, where the visual encoder of CLIP is distilled for frame-wise open-vocabulary object detection, and a trajectory associator. To exploit relationship context during trajectory detection, a relationship query is embedded into the Transformer decoder, and accordingly, an auxiliary relationship loss is designed to enable the decoder to perceive the relationships between objects explicitly. Moreover, we propose an open-vocabulary relationship classifier that leverages the rich semantic knowledge of CLIP to discover novel relationships. To adapt CLIP well to relationship classification, we design a multi-modal prompting method that employs spatio-temporal visual prompting for visual representation and vision-guided language prompting for language input. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our framework is also applied to a more difficult cross-dataset scenario to further demonstrate its generalization ability.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://video-msg.github.io; The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

While recent video diffusion models have made significant progress, existing approaches struggle with limited motion representations and inadequate integration of camera and human motion controls. In this work, we present TokenMotion, the first DiT-based video diffusion framework that enables fine-grained control over camera motion, human motion, and their joint interaction. We represent camera trajectories and human poses as spatio-temporal tokens to enable local control granularity. Our approach introduces a unified modeling framework utilizing a decouple-and-fuse strategy, bridged by a human-aware dynamic mask that effectively handles the spatially-and-temporally varying nature of combined motion signals. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate TokenMotion's effectiveness across both text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in human-centric motion control tasks. Our work represents a significant advancement in controllable video generation, with particular relevance for creative production applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Frame: Generating 360Â° Panoramic Videos from Perspective Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07940v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>360{\deg} videos have emerged as a promising medium to represent our dynamic visual world. Compared to the "tunnel vision" of standard cameras, their borderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our surroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos, their ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the task of video-to-360{\deg} generation: given a perspective video as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is consistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks, the output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required to have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the dynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we first leverage the abundant 360{\deg} videos available online and develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training data. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware operations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of 360{\deg} video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate realistic and coherent 360{\deg} videos from in-the-wild perspective video. In addition, we showcase its potential applications, including video stabilization, camera viewpoint control, and interactive visual question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://red-fairy.github.io/argus/</p></details> |

Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves comparable results compared to recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research 2025; Project page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/latte_project</p></details> |

In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally, incorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop evaluations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, providing adequate home-based assistance remains difficult, particularly in geographically vast regions. Teleoperated robots offer a promising solution, but conventional motion-mapping teleoperation imposes unnatural movement constraints on operators, leading to muscle fatigue and reduced usability. This paper presents a novel teleoperation framework that leverages action recognition to enable intuitive remote robot control. Using our simplified Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (S-ST-GCN), the system recognizes human actions and executes corresponding preset robot trajectories, eliminating the need for direct motion synchronization. A finite-state machine (FSM) is integrated to enhance reliability by filtering out misclassified actions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework enables effortless operator movement while ensuring accurate robot execution. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of teleoperation with action recognition for enabling caregivers to remotely assist older adults during activities of daily living (ADLs). Future work will focus on improving the S-ST-GCN's recognition accuracy and generalization, integrating advanced motion planning techniques to further enhance robotic autonomy in older adult care, and conducting a user study to evaluate the system's telepresence and ease of control.</p></details> |  |

Effectively communicating complex statistical model outputs is a major challenge in public health.

The case study highlights the importance of an intuitive design for fast accessibility, validated data and expert feedback for reliability, aggregated data for security, and insights into prevalence population subgroups, which were previously unobservable, for informativeness. Results. The web application enables stakeholders to explore disease prevalence across populations and geographical area through dynamic visualizations. It facilitates public health monitoring by, for instance, identifying disparities at the local level and assessing risk factors such as smoking. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility, making statistical findings more actionable. Conclusions.

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. HGMamba-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.65 mm and 14.33 mm on the respective datasets.

Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures; |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D pointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene geometry in a feed-forward manner. By explicitly incorporating both spatial and temporal aspects, our approach successfully encapsulates spatio-temporal dense correspondence to the proposed 4D pointmaps, enhancing downstream tasks.

It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely used in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or dynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or event-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur, enhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse lighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these advantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using DVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated event-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study introduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset, capturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream using DVS.In addition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image frames captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS). Both data types were collected using the DAVIS346 camera, which integrates DVS and APS sensors.The dataset focuses on two types of defects: cracks and spalling, and includes data from both field and laboratory environments.

GPUs, though effective accelerators, often face underutilization and rely on coarse-grained scheduling. This paper introduces DARIS, a priority-based real-time DNN scheduler for GPUs, utilizing NVIDIA's MPS and CUDA streaming for spatial sharing, and a synchronization-based staging method for temporal partitioning. In particular, DARIS improves GPU utilization and uniquely analyzes GPU concurrency by oversubscribing computing resources. It also supports zero-delay DNN migration between GPU partitions.

Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%. The code will be available soon on GitHub.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPRW'25 |

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |
| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) captures geographic and interactive factors-such as coaching exchange and socio-economic links-while the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module models historical trends in medal counts, economic data, and demographics. To address zero-inflated outputs (i.e., the disparity between countries that consistently yield wins and those never having won medals), a Zero-Inflated Compound Poisson (ZICP) framework is incorporated to separate random zeros from structural zeros, providing a clearer view of potential breakthrough performances. Validation includes historical backtracking, policy shock simulations, and causal inference checks, confirming the robustness of the proposed method. Results shed light on the influence of coaching mobility, event specialization, and strategic investment on medal forecasts, offering a data-driven foundation for optimizing sports policies and resource allocation in diverse Olympic contexts.</p></details> | 18pages, 7figures |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

The method utilizes geographic and sociodemographic information to represent the fleet's mobility and driving energy needs. It models the charging decisions of drivers based on their driving energy needs and range comfort level using real-world data. The flexibility quantification provides an hourly maximum and minimum bound for the charging power and limits the amount of daily flexible charging energy. We apply the methodology to the future fully electrified fleet of Switzerland as a case study and compare the spatio-temporal characteristics of the charging demand and flexibility of different geographic areas and urbanization levels.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Building such a generalizable model is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing image-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static human). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model as a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background harmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting model that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos without any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is combined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending algorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a post-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image. In the experiments, Comprehensive Relighting shows a strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing image-based human relighting and harmonization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://junyingw.github.io/paper/relighting.

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

At present, fine-grained AGB mapping relies on costly airborne laser scanning acquisition campaigns usually limited to regional scales. Initiatives such as the ESA CCI map attempt to generate global biomass products from diverse spaceborne sensors but at a coarser resolution. To enable global, high-resolution (HR) mapping, several works propose to regress AGB from HR satellite observations such as ESA Sentinel-1/2 images. We propose a novel way to address HR AGB estimation, by leveraging both HR satellite observations and existing low-resolution (LR) biomass products. We cast this problem as Guided Super-Resolution (GSR), aiming at upsampling LR biomass maps (sources) from $100$ to $10$ m resolution, using auxiliary HR co-registered satellite images (guides). We compare super-resolving AGB maps with and without guidance, against direct regression from satellite images, on the public BioMassters dataset. We observe that Multi-Scale Guidance (MSG) outperforms direct regression both for regression ($-780$ t/ha RMSE) and perception ($+2.0$ dB PSNR) metrics, and better captures high-biomass values, without significant computational overhead. Interestingly, unlike the RGB+Depth setting they were originally designed for, our best-performing AGB GSR approaches are those that most preserve the guide image texture. Our results make a strong case for adopting the GSR framework for accurate HR biomass mapping at scale. Our code and model weights are made publicly available (https://github.com/kaankaramanofficial/GSR4B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation at the ISPRS Geospatial Week 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods face challenges such as complex interaction and limited control capabilities. To address these issues, we present OmniCam, a unified multimodal camera control framework. Leveraging large language models and video diffusion models, OmniCam generates spatio-temporally consistent videos. It supports various combinations of input modalities: the user can provide text or video with expected trajectory as camera path guidance, and image or video as content reference, enabling precise control over camera motion. To facilitate the training of OmniCam, we introduce the OmniTr dataset, which contains a large collection of high-quality long-sequence trajectories, videos, and corresponding descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-quality camera-controlled video generation across various metrics.</p></details> |  |

A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

While deep graph-based models demonstrate strong predictive power, their performance often comes at the cost of high computational overhead and substantial training data requirements, making them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained or data-scarce environments. We propose the FlowDistill, a lightweight and scalable traffic prediction framework based on knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). In this teacher-student setup, a fine-tuned LLM guides a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP) student model using a novel combination of the information bottleneck principle and teacher-bounded regression loss, ensuring the distilled model retains only essential and transferable knowledge. Spatial and temporal correlations are explicitly encoded to enhance the model's generalization across diverse urban settings. Despite its simplicity, FlowDistill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy while requiring significantly less training data, and achieving lower memory usage and inference latency, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for real-world, scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

Point clouds are sparse 3D spatial data, which suggests that SNNs should be well-suited for processing them. However, when applying SNNs to point clouds, they often exhibit limited performance and fewer application scenarios. We attribute this to inappropriate preprocessing and feature extraction methods. To address this issue, we first introduce the Spike Voxel Coding (SVC) scheme, which encodes the 3D point clouds into a sparse spike train space, reducing the storage requirements and saving time on point cloud preprocessing. Then, we propose a Spike Sparse Convolution (SSC) model for efficiently extracting 3D sparse point cloud features. Combining SVC and SSC, we design an efficient 3D SNN backbone (E-3DSNN), which is friendly with neuromorphic hardware. For instance, SSC can be implemented on neuromorphic chips with only minor modifications to the addressing function of vanilla spike convolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, KITTI, and Semantic KITTI datasets demonstrate that E-3DSNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with remarkable efficiency. Notably, our E-3DSNN (1.87M) obtained 91.7\% top-1 accuracy on ModelNet40, surpassing the current best SNN baselines (14.3M) by 3.0\%. To our best knowledge, it is the first direct training 3D SNN backbone that can simultaneously handle various 3D computer vision tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation) with an event-driven nature.

However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce the Spiking Dynamic Graph Network (SDGN), a novel framework that leverages the temporal processing capabilities of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to dynamically estimate underlying spatio-temporal functional graphs. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined or static graph structures, SDGN adapts to any dataset by learning dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies directly from the event data, enhancing generalizability and robustness. While SDGN offers significant improvements over prior methods, we acknowledge its limitations in handling dense graphs and certain non-Gaussian dependencies, providing opportunities for future refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets including NYC Taxi, 911, Reddit, and Stack Overflow, demonstrate that SDGN achieves superior predictive accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we include ablation studies to highlight the contributions of its core components.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon and Reliability-Aware Computing for Heterogeneous Data Centers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00518v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of data centers (DCs) has intensified energy and carbon footprint, incurring a massive environmental computing cost. While carbon-aware workload migration strategies have been examined, existing approaches often overlook reliability metrics such as server lifetime degradation, and quality-of-service (QoS) that substantially affects both carbon and operational efficiency of DCs. Hence, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization framework for spatio-temporal workload migration across distributed DCs that jointly minimizes operational and embodied carbon emissions while complying with service-level agreements (SLA). A key contribution is the development of an embodied carbon emission model based on servers' expected lifetime analysis, which explicitly considers server heterogeneity resulting from aging and utilization conditions. These issues are accommodated using new server dispatch strategies, and backup resource allocation model, accounting hardware, software and workload-induced failure. The overall model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem with multiple linearization techniques to ensure computational tractability. Numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces total carbon emissions by up to 21%, offering a pragmatic approach to sustainable DC operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been submitted for review to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and Koopman operators with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13329v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling real-world spatio-temporal data is exceptionally difficult due to inherent high dimensionality, measurement noise, partial observations, and often expensive data collection procedures. In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units to model the temporal sequence of sparse sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatio-temporal field from the latent state space. Our algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization for which the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, a Koopman-SHRED model is generated. SINDy-SHRED (i) learns a symbolic and interpretable generative model of a parsimonious and low-dimensional latent space for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) discovers new physics models even for well-known physical systems, (iii) achieves provably robust convergence with an observed globally convex loss landscape, and (iv) achieves superior accuracy, data efficiency, and training time, all with fewer model parameters. We conduct systematic experimental studies on PDE data such as turbulent flows, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. The interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enable stable and accurate long-term video predictions, outperforming all current baseline deep learning models in accuracy, training time, and data requirements, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Prediction of Fine-Grained Origin-Destination Matrices with Applications in Ridesharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24237v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatial-temporal prediction of network-based travelers' requests is crucial for the effective policy design of ridesharing platforms. Having knowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time slots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby increasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing idle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global supply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to 45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning approaches often operate as black boxes and are vulnerable to spurious correlations, limiting both their reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce FineCausal, a novel causal-based framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineDiving-HM dataset. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network-based causal intervention module to disentangle human-centric foreground cues from background confounders, and incorporates a temporal causal attention module to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies across action stages. This dual-module strategy enables FineCausal to generate detailed spatio-temporal representations that not only achieve state-of-the-art scoring performance but also provide transparent, interpretable feedback on which features drive the assessment. Despite its strong performance, FineCausal requires extensive expert knowledge to define causal structures and depends on high-quality annotations, challenges that we discuss and address as future research directions.

| **[A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform Band-pass Filter Extension for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23493v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces a novel extension, called the Extended Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (EKZFT), to an existing class of band-pass filters first introduced by Kolmogorov and Zurbenko. Their original Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (KZFT) is a useful tool in time series and spatio-temporal analysis, Fourier analysis, and related statistical analysis fields. Example uses of these filters include separating frequencies, filtering portions of the spectra, reconstructing seasonality, investigating periodic signals, and reducing noise. KZFT filters have many practical applications across a wide range of disciplines including health, social, natural, and physical sciences. KZFT filters are band-pass filters defined by three arguments: the length of the filter window; the number of iterations; and the central frequency of the band-pass filter. However, the KZFT filter is limited in design to only positive odd integer widow lengths inherited from the time series. Therefore, for any combination of the other KZFT filter arguments, there is only a relatively small, discrete, selection of possible filter window lengths in a range determined by the size of the dataset. This limits the utility of KZFT filters for many of the stated uses. The proposed EKZFT filter allows a continuous selection of filter window length arguments over the same range, offering improved control, increased functionality, and wider practical use of this band-pass filter. An example application of the EKZFT in a data simulation is provided.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing actions in videos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address this, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange information and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding, we extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in Visual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different characteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400, consistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on audio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound, KineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across these datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among multiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and CAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention, achieving balanced and holistic video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, TPAMI under review</p></details> |
| **[MMAD: Multi-label Micro-Action Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05311v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks. Our code, model, and dataset will be made publicly available at https://javisdit.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

The most current approach to processing Event Cloud often involves converting it into frame-based representations, which neglects the sparsity of events, loses fine-grained temporal information, and increases the computational burden. In contrast, Point Cloud is a popular representation for processing 3-dimensional data and serves as an alternative method to exploit local and global spatial features. Nevertheless, previous point-based methods show an unsatisfactory performance compared to the frame-based method in dealing with spatio-temporal event streams. In order to bridge the gap, we propose EventMamba, an efficient and effective framework based on Point Cloud representation by rethinking the distinction between Event Cloud and Point Cloud, emphasizing vital temporal information. The Event Cloud is subsequently fed into a hierarchical structure with staged modules to process both implicit and explicit temporal features. Specifically, we redesign the global extractor to enhance explicit temporal extraction among a long sequence of events with temporal aggregation and State Space Model (SSM) based Mamba. Our model consumes minimal computational resources in the experiments and still exhibits SOTA point-based performance on six different scales of action recognition datasets. It even outperformed all frame-based methods on both Camera Pose Relocalization (CPR) and eye-tracking regression tasks.

We study the use of the Greta software for Bayesian inference to apply Gaussian process regression to spatio-temporal data of infectious disease outbreaks and predict future disease spread. Greta builds on Tensorflow, making it comparatively easy to take advantage of the significant gain in speed offered by GPUs. In these complex spatio-temporal models, we show a reduction of up to 70\% in computational time relative to fitting the same models on CPUs. We show how the choice of covariance kernel impacts the ability to infer spread and extrapolate to unobserved spatial and temporal units. The inference pipeline is applied to weekly incidence data on tuberculosis in the East and West Midlands regions of England over a period of two years.</p></details> |  |

These data not only reveal users' spatio-temporal information but also provide insights into their behavior patterns and interests. However, cross-platform identity linkage faces challenges like poor data quality, high sparsity, and noise interference, which hinder existing methods from extracting cross-platform user information. To address these issues, we propose a Correlation-Attention Masked Transformer for User Identity Linkage Network (MT-Link), a transformer-based framework to enhance model performance by learning spatio-temporal co-occurrence patterns of cross-platform users. Our model effectively captures spatio-temporal co-occurrence in cross-platform user check-in sequences. It employs a correlation attention mechanism to detect the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between user check-in sequences. Guided by attention weight maps, the model focuses on co-occurrence points while filtering out noise, ultimately improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 12.92%~17.76% and 5.80%~8.38% improvements in terms of Macro-F1 and Area Under Curve (AUC).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recent studies focus on integrating spatiotemporal information obtained from past observations to improve prediction accuracy, using a multi-frame fusion approach that processes multiple past frames together. However, these methods struggle with a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which significantly limits their practicality. To mitigate this trade-off, we propose StreamOcc, a novel framework that aggregates spatio-temporal information in a stream-based manner. StreamOcc consists of two key components: (i) Stream-based Voxel Aggregation, which effectively accumulates past observations while minimizing computational costs, and (ii) Query-guided Aggregation, which recurrently aggregates instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features, refining fine-grained details of dynamic objects. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that StreamOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time settings, while reducing memory usage by more than 50% compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

Accurate estimation of ride-sharing improves service utilization and reliability and reduces travel time and traffic congestion. In this study, we employ two Bayesian models to estimate ride-sharing demand in the 77 Chicago community areas. We consider demographic, scoio-economic, transportation factors as well as land-use characteristics as explanatory variables. Our models assume conditional autoregression (CAR) prior for the explanatory variables. Moreover, the Bayesian frameworks estimate both the unstructured random error and the struc-tured errors for the spatial and the spatiotemporal correlation. We assessed the performance of the estimated models and the residuals of the spatial regression model have no left-over spatial structure. For the spatiotemporal model, the squared correlation between actual ride-shares and the fitted values is 0.95. Our analysis revealed that the demographic factors (populations size and registered crimes) positively impact the ride-sharing demand. Additionally, the ride-sharing demand increases with higher income and increase in the economically active propor-tion of the population as well as the residents with no cars. Moreover, the transit availability and the walkability indices are crucial determinants for the ridesharing in Chicago.</p></details> |  |

| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04059v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[How Deep is your Guess? A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSTI: Consistency Models for (a faster) Spatio-Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19364v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Imputation (MTSI) is crucial for many applications, such as healthcare monitoring and traffic management, where incomplete data can compromise decision-making. Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[BRATI: Bidirectional Recurrent Attention for Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05401v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data in time-series analysis poses significant challenges, affecting the reliability of downstream applications. Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSI-Bench: Benchmarking Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12747v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

| **[Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01742v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are becoming the leading paradigm for generative models. It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffImp: Efficient Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation with Bidirectional Mamba Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06652v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow. The proposed method leverages the (conditional) optimal transport theory to learn the probability flow in a simulation-free manner, in which the initial noise, missing data, and observations are treated as the source distribution, target distribution, and conditional information, respectively. According to the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to incorporate more prior information into the model, we parameterize the derivative of a task-specific potential function via a variational autoencoder, and combine it with the base estimator to formulate a Rao-Blackwellized sampler. The propose model allows us to take less intermediate steps to produce high-quality samples for inference compared to existing diffusion methods. Finally, the experimental results on the real-word datasets show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on time series imputation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TIMBA: Time series Imputation with Bi-directional Mamba Blocks and Diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05916v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of imputing multivariate time series spans a wide range of fields, from clinical healthcare to multi-sensor systems. Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Interpolants for Probabilistic Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11684v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential models like recurrent neural networks and transformers have become standard for probabilistic multivariate time series forecasting across various domains. Despite their strengths, they struggle with capturing high-dimensional distributions and cross-feature dependencies. Recent work explores generative approaches using diffusion or flow-based models, extending to time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability remains a challenge. This work proposes a novel method combining recurrent neural networks' efficiency with diffusion models' probabilistic modeling, based on stochastic interpolants and conditional generation with control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models. Our code is available at https://github.com/gorgen2020/HSPGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, CIKM 2024</p></details> |

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

The issue of uncovering interaction relations in such systems using observable dynamics is called relational inference.

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImDiffusion: Imputed Diffusion Models for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00754v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is of paramount importance for ensuring the efficient operation of large-scale systems across diverse domains. However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, which conducts projections onto every other marginal alternatingly. However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data. We show that optimizing the transport cost improves the performance and the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art result in healthcare and environmental data while exhibiting the advantage of exploring both temporal and feature patterns in probabilistic time series imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |

Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones.

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502v2)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |
| **[CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09904v2)** | 2019-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications involve multivariate, geo-tagged time series data: at each location, multiple sensors record corresponding measurements. For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world problems data has missing values, which may difficult the application of machine learning techniques to extract information. In this paper we focus on the task of imputation of time series. Many imputation methods for time series are based on regression methods. Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly when the variables are categorical. To address this case, we propose a new imputation method based on Expectation Maximization over dynamic Bayesian networks. The approach is assessed with synthetic and real data, and it outperforms several state-of-the art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master paper, draft to be submitted</p></details> |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |

These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

Existing works typically assume regularly sampled, well-structured data, limiting their applicability to more generalized scenarios where time series often contain missing values, unequal sequence lengths, and irregular time intervals between measurements. To cover diverse domains and handle variable regularities, we propose FlexTSF, a universal time series forecasting model that possesses better generalization and natively support both regular and irregular time series. FlexTSF produces forecasts in an autoregressive manner and incorporates three novel designs: VT-Norm, a normalization strategy to ablate data domain barriers, IVP Patcher, a patching module to learn representations from flexibly structured time series, and LED attention, an attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these two and propagate forecasts with awareness of domain and time information. Experiments on 12 datasets show that FlexTSF outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models respectively designed for regular and irregular time series. Furthermore, after self-supervised pre-training, FlexTSF shows exceptional performance in both zero-shot and few-show settings for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08732v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqLink: A Robust Neural-ODE Architecture for Modelling Partially Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03560v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models have become popular as foundation models for solving many time series problems. Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-time Autoencoders for Regular and Irregular Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16581v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most fundamental tasks for time series. Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians. In experiments on four different datasets we show that moses outperforms other state-of-the-art marginalization consistent models, performs on par with ProFITi, but different from ProFITi, guarantee marginalization consistency.</p></details> |  |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |

Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |

Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |

Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learnable Path in Neural Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04333v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs), which are continuous analogues to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are a specialized model in (irregular) time-series processing. In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |
| **[COPER: Continuous Patient State Perceiver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03196v2)** | 2022-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In electronic health records (EHRs), irregular time-series (ITS) occur naturally due to patient health dynamics, reflected by irregular hospital visits, diseases/conditions and the necessity to measure different vitals signs at each visit etc. ITS present challenges in training machine learning algorithms which mostly are built on assumption of coherent fixed dimensional feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Time series data types can be broadly classified into regular or irregular. However, there are no existing generative models that show good performance for both types without any model changes. Therefore, we present a general purpose model capable of synthesizing regular and irregular time series data. To our knowledge, we are the first designing a general purpose time series synthesis model, which is one of the most challenging settings for time series synthesis. To this end, we design a generative adversarial network-based method, where many related techniques are carefully integrated into a single framework, ranging from neural ordinary/controlled differential equations to continuous time-flow processes. Our method outperforms all existing methods.</p></details> | NeurIPs 2022 |
| **[EXIT: Extrapolation and Interpolation-based Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Time-series Classification and Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08771v2)** | 2022-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning inspired by differential equations is a recent research trend and has marked the state of the art performance for many machine learning tasks. Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |
| **[Features Fusion Framework for Multimodal Irregular Time-series Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01728v1)** | 2022-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some data from multiple sources can be modeled as multimodal time-series events which have different sampling frequencies, data compositions, temporal relations and characteristics. Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop&Hop: Early Classification of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09795v1)** | 2022-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early classification algorithms help users react faster to their machine learning model's predictions. Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

| **[Modeling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11344v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modeling sequential data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |

Hence, a model that combines the use of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and RNN was proposed (ODE-RNN) to model irregular time series with higher accuracy, but it suffers from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins.

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Convolutions: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Raw Seismic Data Ingestion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13631v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional seismic processing workflows (SPW) are expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926v2)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Model for Demand and Supply Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12469v1)** | 2020-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for demand forecasting only focus on modeling the temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches focus on classification, regression or forecasting tasks on such data.

| **[Discrete-time autoregressive model for unequally spaced time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11158v1)** | 2019-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, directly repurposing the generative denoising process for discriminative objectives reveals critical gaps rarely addressed previously. Generative models tolerate intermediate sampling errors if the final distribution remains plausible, but discriminative tasks require rigorous accuracy throughout, as evidenced in challenging multi-modal tasks like referring image segmentation. Motivated by this gap, we analyze and enhance alignment between generative diffusion processes and perception tasks, focusing on how perception quality evolves during denoising. We find: (1) earlier denoising steps contribute disproportionately to perception quality, prompting us to propose tailored learning objectives reflecting varying timestep contributions; (2) later denoising steps show unexpected perception degradation, highlighting sensitivity to training-denoising distribution shifts, addressed by our diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and (3) generative processes uniquely enable interactivity, serving as controllable user interfaces adaptable to correctional prompts in multi-round interactions. Our insights significantly improve diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation, referring image segmentation, and generalist perception tasks.

Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation.

While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image scenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains a formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with temporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to concentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a two-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning to preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details from diverse videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Project Page: https://normalcrafter.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ADT: Tuning Diffusion Models with Adversarial Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11423v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a forward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During training, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true samples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising starting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the alignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential prediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial Diffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during optimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial supervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features a siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and lightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling strategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original diffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully constrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the inference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion. Finally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3), demonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and image quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

| **[Autoregressive Distillation of Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11295v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models with transformer architectures have demonstrated promising capabilities in generating high-fidelity images and scalability for high resolution. However, iterative sampling process required for synthesis is very resource-intensive. A line of work has focused on distilling solutions to probability flow ODEs into few-step student models. Nevertheless, existing methods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples as input, rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a novel approach that leverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD offers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted historical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors, and 2) it leverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source of coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer architecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the trajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training. Furthermore, incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers enhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a class-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis. Our model achieves a $5\times$ reduction in FID degradation compared to the baseline methods while requiring only 1.1\% extra FLOPs on ImageNet-256. Moreover, ARD reaches FID of 1.84 on ImageNet-256 in merely 4 steps and outperforms the publicly available 1024p text-to-image distilled models in prompt adherence score with a minimal drop in FID compared to the teacher.

These two-stage approaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then a segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid framework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training. CyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation between microscopy images and segmentation masks. We embed a segmentation model into CycleGAN and leverage a cycle consistency loss for self-supervision.

To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical images from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard Diffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one without and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which blends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated images in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud removal. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they still provide valuable information. Our results show that class conditioning improves classification accuracy, while cloud removal performance remains competitive despite our approach not being optimized for it. Interestingly, despite exhibiting lower perceptual quality, the Cold Diffusion setup performs well in land cover classification, suggesting that traditional quantitative evaluation metrics may not fully reflect the practical utility of generated images. Our findings highlight the potential of DMs for SAR-to-RGB translation in RS applications where RGB images are missing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Taming Consistency Distillation for Accelerated Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11143v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in human image animation have been propelled by video diffusion models, yet their reliance on numerous iterative denoising steps results in high inference costs and slow speeds. An intuitive solution involves adopting consistency models, which serve as an effective acceleration paradigm through consistency distillation. However, simply employing this strategy in human image animation often leads to quality decline, including visual blurring, motion degradation, and facial distortion, particularly in dynamic regions. In this paper, we propose the DanceLCM approach complemented by several enhancements to improve visual quality and motion continuity at low-step regime: (1) segmented consistency distillation with an auxiliary light-weight head to incorporate supervision from real video latents, mitigating cumulative errors resulting from single full-trajectory generation; (2) a motion-focused loss to centre on motion regions, and explicit injection of facial fidelity features to improve face authenticity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DanceLCM achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video diffusion models with a mere 2-4 inference steps, significantly reducing the inference burden without compromising video quality. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\%.

However, it is typically tailored to the specific attack types it is trained on, limiting its ability to generalize to unseen threat models. Adversarial purification offers an alternative by leveraging a generative model to remove perturbations before classification. Since the purifier is trained independently of both the classifier and the threat models, it is better equipped to handle previously unseen attack scenarios. Diffusion models have proven highly effective for noise purification, not only in countering pixel-wise adversarial perturbations but also in addressing non-adversarial data shifts. In this study, we broaden the focus beyond pixel-wise robustness to explore the extent to which purification can mitigate both spectral and spatial adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight its effectiveness in handling diverse distortion patterns across low- to high-frequency regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 5th Workshop on Adversarial Machine Learning in Computer Vision: Foundation Models + X</p></details> |

While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

| **[TMCIR: Token Merge Benefits Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10995v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05473 by other authors</p></details> |

Deep generative methods, such as autoregressive models and diffusion models, have greatly accelerated the discovery of novel protein sequences. However, these methods mainly focus on local or shallow residual semantics and suffer from low inference efficiency, large modeling space and high training cost. To address these challenges, we introduce ProtFlow, a fast flow matching-based protein sequence design framework that operates on embeddings derived from semantically meaningful latent space of protein language models. By compressing and smoothing the latent space, ProtFlow enhances performance while training on limited computational resources. Leveraging reflow techniques, ProtFlow enables high-quality single-step sequence generation. Additionally, we develop a joint design pipeline for the design scene of multichain proteins. We evaluate ProtFlow across diverse protein design tasks, including general peptides and long-chain proteins, antimicrobial peptides, and antibodies. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtFlow outperforms task-specific methods in these applications, underscoring its potential and broad applicability in computational protein sequence design and analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctGPT: Octree-based Multiscale Autoregressive Models for 3D Shape Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09975v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their performance in 3D shape generation lags significantly behind that of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce OctGPT, a novel multiscale autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that dramatically improves the efficiency and performance of prior 3D autoregressive approaches, while rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method employs a serialized octree representation to efficiently capture the hierarchical and spatial structures of 3D shapes. Coarse geometry is encoded via octree structures, while fine-grained details are represented by binary tokens generated using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), transforming 3D shapes into compact multiscale binary sequences suitable for autoregressive prediction. To address the computational challenges of handling long sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with 3D rotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel generation schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and generation time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution 3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days. OctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-, sketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis involving multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OctGPT accelerates convergence and improves generation quality over prior autoregressive methods, offering a new paradigm for high-quality, scalable 3D content creation.

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions.

These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.</p></details> | under preview |
| **[Bringing together invertible UNets with invertible attention modules for memory-efficient diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10883v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained state of the art performance on many image generation tasks. However, most models require significant computational resources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical image synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs, electron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a single GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet architecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two contributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to be independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy usage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of image generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020 dataset leading to up to 15\% decrease in peak memory consumption during training with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[PT-Mark: Invisible Watermarking for Text-to-image Diffusion Models via Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10853v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking for diffusion images has drawn considerable attention due to the widespread use of text-to-image diffusion models and the increasing need for their copyright protection. Recently, advanced watermarking techniques, such as Tree Ring, integrate watermarks by embedding traceable patterns (e.g., Rings) into the latent distribution during the diffusion process. Such methods disrupt the original semantics of the generated images due to the inevitable distribution shift caused by the watermarks, thereby limiting their practicality, particularly in digital art creation. In this work, we present Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning Watermarks (PT-Mark), a novel invisible watermarking method that preserves both the semantics of diffusion images and the traceability of the watermark. PT-Mark preserves the original semantics of the watermarked image by gradually aligning the generation trajectory with the original (pivotal) trajectory while maintaining the traceable watermarks during whole diffusion denoising process. To achieve this, we first compute the salient regions of the watermark at each diffusion denoising step as a spatial prior to identify areas that can be aligned without disrupting the watermark pattern. Guided by the region, we then introduce an additional pivotal tuning branch that optimizes the text embedding to align the semantics while preserving the watermarks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PT-Mark can preserve the original semantics of the diffusion images while integrating robust watermarks. It achieves a 10% improvement in the performance of semantic preservation (i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art watermarking methods, while also showing comparable robustness against real-world perturbations and four times greater efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-Guided and Personalized Music Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10826v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes for editing. However, these methods often struggle to maintain the music content consistency. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that enhance the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into any user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality. Audio examples are available on https://steermusic.pages.dev/.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, OmniVDiff treats all video visual modalities in the color space to learn a joint distribution, while employing an adaptive control strategy that dynamically adjusts the role of each visual modality during the diffusion process, either as a generation modality or a conditioning modality. This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's role, enabling support for a wide range of tasks. Consequently, our model supports three key functionalities: (1) Text-conditioned video generation: multi-modal visual video sequences (i.e., rgb, depth, canny, segmentaion) are generated based on the text conditions in one diffusion process; (2) Video understanding: OmniVDiff can estimate the depth, canny map, and semantic segmentation across the input rgb frames while ensuring coherence with the rgb input; and (3) X-conditioned video generation: OmniVDiff generates videos conditioned on fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth maps or segmentation maps). By integrating these diverse tasks into a unified video diffusion framework, OmniVDiff enhances the flexibility and scalability for controllable video diffusion, making it an effective tool for a variety of downstream applications, such as video-to-video translation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for various video-related applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/OmniVDiff/</p></details> |

While video recordings of sign language are commonly used for education and documentation, the dynamic nature of signs can make it challenging to study them in detail, especially for new learners and educators. This work aims to convert sign language video footage into static illustrations, which serve as an additional educational resource to complement video content. This process is usually done by an artist, and is therefore quite costly. We propose a method that illustrates sign language videos by leveraging generative models' ability to understand both the semantic and geometric aspects of images. Our approach focuses on transferring a sketch like illustration style to video footage of sign language, combining the start and end frames of a sign into a single illustration, and using arrows to highlight the hand's direction and motion. While many style transfer methods address domain adaptation at varying levels of abstraction, applying a sketch like style to sign languages, especially for hand gestures and facial expressions, poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, we intervene in the denoising process of a diffusion model, injecting style as keys and values into high resolution attention layers, and fusing geometric information from the image and edges as queries. For the final illustration, we use the attention mechanism to combine the attention weights from both the start and end illustrations, resulting in a soft combination. Our method offers a cost effective solution for generating sign language illustrations at inference time, addressing the lack of such resources in educational materials.</p></details> |  |

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. The code to reproduce our method will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic interpolation generates a data sample by first randomly initializing a particle drawn from a simple base distribution, then simulating deterministic or stochastic dynamics such that in finite time the particle's distribution converges to the target. We show that for a Gaussian base distribution and a strongly log-concave target distribution, the stochastic interpolation flow map is Lipschitz with a sharp constant which matches that of Caffarelli's theorem for optimal transport maps. We are further able to construct Lipschitz transport maps between non-Gaussian distributions, generalizing some recent constructions in the literature on transport methods for establishing functional inequalities. We discuss the practical implications of our theorem for the sampling and estimation problems required by stochastic interpolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proof...</summary><p>Proof of concept.

Traditional methods have often been limited to single or dual-modality approaches. In this paper, we introduce COP-GEN-Beta, a generative diffusion model trained on optical, radar, and elevation data from the Major TOM dataset. What sets COP-GEN-Beta apart is its ability to map any subset of modalities to any other, enabling zero-shot modality translation after training. This is achieved through a sequence-based diffusion transformer, where each modality is controlled by its own timestep embedding. We extensively evaluate COP-GEN-Beta on thumbnail images from the Major TOM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality samples. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the model's performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful pre-trained model for future remote sensing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop MORSE</p></details> |

Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time on mobile devices. We also unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single network. In addition, we find that the widely adopted discriminative losses, i.e., GAN, LPIPS, and DWT losses, provide no significant improvements when training AEs at scale. We propose a novel latent consistency loss that does not require complicated discriminator design or hyperparameter tuning, but provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Our AE achieves an ultra-high compression ratio and real-time decoding speed on mobile while outperforming prior art in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

| **[Anchor Token Matching: Implicit Structure Locking for Training-free AR Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10434v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models.

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage.

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns.

Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Video: https://youtu.be/QuIYTljvhyg Project Page: https://tangjiapeng.github.io/projects/GAF</p></details> |

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability density estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between objects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object and temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing. Inspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a progressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers from sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the backbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global feature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of sparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic affinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable high-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object representation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and Global Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning mechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the progressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport assignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each denoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to counteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects. Experiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method based on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential relationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection capability and temporal consistency.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we introduce RHanDS, a conditional diffusion-based framework designed to refine malformed hands by utilizing decoupled structure and style guidance. The hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand offers structure guidance for correcting the structure of the hand, while the malformed hand itself provides style guidance for preserving the style of the hand. To alleviate the mutual interference between style and structure guidance, we introduce a two-stage training strategy and build a series of multi-style hand datasets. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to ensure stylistic consistency in hand refining. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on human meshes are used for training, enabling the model to gain control over the hand structure. Experimental results demonstrate that RHanDS can effectively refine hand structure while preserving consistency in hand style.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Decoupled Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems using Data Consistency Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00664v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in producing synthetic data that satisfies the Generative Learning Trilemma: fidelity, diversity, and sampling efficiency. However, recognizing that these criteria alone are insufficient for practical applications, we extend the trilemma to include utility, robustness, and privacy, factors crucial for ensuring the applicability of DGMs in real-world scenarios. Evaluating these metrics becomes particularly challenging in data-scarce environments, as DGMs traditionally rely on large datasets to perform optimally. This limitation is especially pronounced in domains like medicine and precision agriculture, where ensuring acceptable model performance under data constraints is vital. To address these challenges, we assess the Generative Learning Trilemma in data-scarcity settings using state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, comparing three prominent DGMs: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework to assess utility, robustness, and privacy in synthetic data generated by DGMs. Our findings demonstrate varying strengths among DGMs, with each model exhibiting unique advantages based on the application context. This study broadens the scope of the Generative Learning Trilemma, aligning it with real-world demands and providing actionable guidance for selecting DGMs tailored to specific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Generative Model Training via Embedded Representation Warmup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10188v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose DartControl, in short DART, a Diffusion-based Autoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control. Our model effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally, the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model's versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks. Experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines in motion realism, efficiency, and controllability.

Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods.

Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Such systems frequently arise from spatial discretizations of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). For instance, $G$ could involve higher-order derivative terms with nonlinear coefficients. Traditional IMEX-RK methods, which treat $\mathbf{f}$ explicitly and $G\mathbf{u}$ implicitly, require solving nonlinear systems at each time step when $G$ depends on $\mathbf{u}$, leading to increased computational cost and complexity. In contrast, the proposed semi-IMEX scheme treats $G$ explicitly while keeping $\mathbf{u}$ implicit, reducing the problem to solving only linear systems. This approach eliminates the need to compute Jacobians while preserving the stability advantages of implicit methods. A family of semi-IMEX RK schemes with varying orders of accuracy is introduced. Numerical simulations for various nonlinear equations, including nonlinear diffusion models, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, confirm the expected convergence rates and demonstrate that the proposed method allows for larger time step sizes without triggering stability issues.</p></details> |  |

The controllability challenges include generating a motion of a length that matches the given textual description and editing the generated motions according to control signals, such as the start-end positions and the pelvis trajectory. In this paper, we propose MoLA, which provides fast, high-quality, variable-length motion generation and can also deal with multiple editing tasks in a single framework. Our approach revisits the motion representation used as inputs and outputs in the model, incorporating an activation variable to enable variable-length motion generation. Additionally, we integrate a variational autoencoder and a latent diffusion model, further enhanced through adversarial training, to achieve high-quality and fast generation. Moreover, we apply a training-free guided generation framework to achieve various editing tasks with motion control inputs. We quantitatively show the effectiveness of adversarial learning in text-to-motion generation, and demonstrate the applicability of our editing framework to multiple editing tasks in the motion domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 HuMoGen Workshop</p></details> |

However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content. Furthermore, we exemplify the generalization ability of our method to other local video editing tasks by applying it successfully to facial sticker-removal. Our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the potential of leveraging synthetic data and strong video priors for local video editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate synchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the critical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based generation framework that independently models each hand's motion via dual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while leveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated Asymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise to highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing inter-hand coordination during denoising. The system operates hierarchically: it first predicts 3D hand positions from audio features and then generates joint angles through position-aware diffusion models, where parallel denoising streams interact via HCAA. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.</p></details> |  |

Ongoing work in climate science and ocean modeling motivates the use of stochastic SGS models for chaotic dynamics. Further, developing stochastic generative models of underlying dynamics is a rapidly expanding field. In this work, we aim to incorporate stochastic integration toward closure modeling for chaotic dynamical systems. Further, we want to explore the potential stabilizing effect that stochastic models could have on linearized chaotic systems. We propose parametric and generative approaches for closure modeling using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We derive and implement a quadratic diffusion model based on the fluctuations, demonstrating increased accuracy from bridging theoretical models with generative approaches. Results are demonstrated on the Lorenz-63 dynamical system.</p></details> |  |

At each time step during diffusion denoising, our algorithm forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions. Central to our method is the unique analogy between diffusion models, which are rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and the Black-Scholes model for financial option pricing. By drawing parallels between key variables in both domains, we derive a robust algorithm for concept blending that capitalizes on the Markovian dynamics of the Black-Scholes framework. Our text-based concept blending algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training. Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively to other text based concept blending techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds. Our work shows that financially inspired techniques can enhance text-to-image concept blending in generative AI, paving the way for broader innovation.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> |

However, existing models still fail to perform local edits, follow detailed editing prompts, or maintain global image quality beyond a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and improves image quality consistently during more than 100 editing steps. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. SPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic image-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal, replacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and structural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the highest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but it is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 21 figures.

In this paper, we propose EB-Diff-Train, a new efficient DM training approach that is orthogonal to other methods of accelerating DM training, by investigating and leveraging Early-Bird (EB) tickets -- sparse subnetworks that manifest early in the training process and maintain high generation quality. We first investigate the existence of traditional EB tickets in DMs, enabling competitive generation quality without fully training a dense model. Then, we delve into the concept of diffusion-dedicated EB tickets, drawing on insights from varying importance of different timestep regions. These tickets adapt their sparsity levels according to the importance of corresponding timestep regions, allowing for aggressive sparsity during non-critical regions while conserving computational resources for crucial timestep regions. Building on this, we develop an efficient DM training technique that derives timestep-aware EB tickets, trains them in parallel, and combines them during inference for image generation. Extensive experiments validate the existence of both traditional and timestep-aware EB tickets, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed EB-Diff-Train method. This approach can significantly reduce training time both spatially and temporally -- achieving 2.9$\times$ to 5.8$\times$ speedups over training unpruned dense models, and up to 10.3$\times$ faster training compared to standard train-prune-finetune pipelines -- without compromising generative quality.

We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

However, the existing OBI datasets suffer from a long-tail distribution problem, leading to biased performance of OBI recognition models across majority and minority classes. With recent advancements in generative models, OBI synthesis-based data augmentation has become a promising avenue to expand the sample size of minority classes. Unfortunately, current OBI datasets lack large-scale structure-aligned image pairs for generative model training. To address these problems, we first present the Oracle-P15K, a structure-aligned OBI dataset for OBI generation and denoising, consisting of 14,542 images infused with domain knowledge from OBI experts. Second, we propose a diffusion model-based pseudo OBI generator, called OBIDiff, to achieve realistic and controllable OBI generation. Given a clean glyph image and a target rubbing-style image, it can effectively transfer the noise style of the original rubbing to the glyph image. Extensive experiments on OBI downstream tasks and user preference studies show the effectiveness of the proposed Oracle-P15K dataset and demonstrate that OBIDiff can accurately preserve inherent glyph structures while transferring authentic rubbing styles effectively.</p></details> |  |

Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle, preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore, our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, methods that use neural networks in a simple L2-regression setup fail to approximate multi-modal (set-valued) solution distributions caused by local optima found by the numerical solver or non-convex constraints, such as obstacles, significantly limiting the applicability of approximate MPC in practice. We solve this issue by using diffusion models to accurately represent the complete solution distribution (i.e., all modes) at high control rates (more than 1000 Hz). This work shows that diffusion based AMPC significantly outperforms L2-regression-based approximate MPC for multi-modal action distributions. In contrast to most earlier work on IL, we also focus on running the diffusion-based controller at a higher rate and in joint space instead of end-effector space. Additionally, we propose the use of gradient guidance during the denoising process to consistently pick the same mode in closed loop to prevent switching between solutions. We propose using the cost and constraint satisfaction of the original MPC problem during parallel sampling of solutions from the diffusion model to pick a better mode online. We evaluate our method on the fast and accurate control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator both in simulation and on hardware deployed at 250 Hz, achieving a speedup of more than 70 times compared to solving the MPC problem online and also outperforming the numerical optimization (used for training) in success ratio.

However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  |

While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CamMimic: Zero-Shot Image To Camera Motion Personalized Video Generation Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09472v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CamMimic, an innovative algorithm tailored for dynamic video editing needs. It is designed to seamlessly transfer the camera motion observed in a given reference video onto any scene of the user's choice in a zero-shot manner without requiring any additional data. Our algorithm achieves this using a two-phase strategy by leveraging a text-to-video diffusion model. In the first phase, we develop a multi-concept learning method using a combination of LoRA layers and an orthogonality loss to capture and understand the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics of the reference video as well as the spatial features of the user's desired scene. The second phase proposes a unique homography-based refinement strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial alignment of the generated video. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments conducted on a dataset containing combinations of diverse scenes and reference videos containing a variety of camera motions. In the absence of an established metric for assessing camera motion transfer between unrelated scenes, we propose CameraScore, a novel metric that utilizes homography representations to measure camera motion similarity between the reference and generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates high-quality, motion-enhanced videos. Additionally, a user study reveals that 70.31% of participants preferred our method for scene preservation, while 90.45% favored it for motion transfer. We hope this work lays the foundation for future advancements in camera motion transfer across different scenes.</p></details> |  |

Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across different image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the naturally varying information densities present in these regions. However, large compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression increases computational complexity and compromises global consistency, ultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these limitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by recognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of image generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical encoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates, tailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more accurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting multi-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth regions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an novel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content Transformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed regions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local realism. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released at https://github.com/jiawn-creator/Dynamic-DiT.</p></details> |  |

However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08643v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDE, while aligning with the degraded objective function. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Wasserstein Convergence and Straightness of Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14949v6)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) proposed Rectified Flow (RF), a generative model that aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a novel formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work. Secondly, we present general conditions guaranteeing uniqueness and straightness of 1-RF, which is in line with previous empirical findings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that, in one dimension, RF started at the standard Gaussian distribution yields the Monge map. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings. The code is available at https://github.com/bansal-vansh/rectified-flow.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical image translation, Diffusion model, 16 pages</p></details> |

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

In Stage 1, a character-agnostic diffusion model synthesizes transitions from sparse keyframes on a canonical skeleton, allowing the same model to generalize across diverse characters. In Stage 2, a reinforcement learning-based controller adapts the canonical motion to the target character's morphology and dynamics, correcting artifacts and enhancing stylistic realism. This design supports scalable motion generation across characters with diverse skeletons without retraining the entire model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and stylized characters demonstrate that our method produces physically plausible, style-consistent motions under sparse and long-range constraints.</p></details> |  |

To address data scarcity, we propose an end-to-end system for synthetic data generation for scalable, high-quality, and customizable 3D indoor scenes. By integrating and adapting text-to-image and multi-view diffusion models with Neural Radiance Field-based meshing, this system generates highfidelity 3D object assets from text prompts and incorporates them into pre-defined floor plans using a rendering tool. By introducing novel loss functions and training strategies into existing methods, the system supports on-demand scene generation, aiming to alleviate the scarcity of current available data, generally manually crafted by artists. This system advances the role of synthetic data in addressing machine learning training limitations, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Synthetic Data</p></details> |

Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine details are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically when considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology, making realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent diffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a fixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image acquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details. MedIL utilizes implicit neural representations to treat images as continuous signals, where encoding and decoding can be performed at arbitrary resolutions without prior resampling. We quantitatively and qualitatively show how MedIL compresses and preserves clinically-relevant features over large multi-site, multi-resolution datasets of both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs. We further demonstrate how MedIL can influence the quality of images generated with a diffusion model, and discuss how MedIL can enhance generative models to resemble raw clinical acquisitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05431v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 17 figures.

Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[WikiStyle+: A Multimodal Approach to Content-Style Representation Disentanglement for Artistic Image Stylization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14496v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic image stylization aims to render the content provided by text or image with the target style, where content and style decoupling is the key to achieve satisfactory results. However, current methods for content and style disentanglement primarily rely on image supervision, which leads to two problems: 1) models can only support one modality for style or content input;2) incomplete disentanglement resulting in content leakage from the reference image. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal approach to content-style disentanglement for artistic image stylization. We construct a \textit{WikiStyle+} dataset consists of artworks with corresponding textual descriptions for style and content. Based on the multimodal dataset, we propose a disentangled representations-guided diffusion model. The disentangled representations are first learned by Q-Formers and then injected into a pre-trained diffusion model using learnable multi-step cross-attention layers. Experimental results show that our method achieves a thorough disentanglement of content and style in reference images under multimodal supervision, thereby enabling more refined stylization that aligns with the artistic characteristics of the reference style. The code of our method will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a computational framework by utilizing the novel Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) to enhance the accuracy of state estimation for two-phase flow systems in porous media. The forward simulation of the two-phase flow model is implemented using a mixed finite element method, which ensures accurate approximation of the pressure, the velocity, and the saturation. The EnSF leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate filtering distributions efficiently, avoiding the computational expense of neural network-based methods. By incorporating a closed-form score approximation and an analytical update mechanism, the EnSF overcomes degeneracy issues and handles high-dimensional nonlinear filtering with minimal computational overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of EnSF in scenarios with uncertain permeability and incomplete observational data.</p></details> |  |

For example, previous works have shown how teleoperation, corrective, and discrete (i.e., preference over a small number of choices) input can enable robots to complete complex tasks. However, few previous works have looked at combining different methods, and in particular, opportunities for a robot to estimate and elicit the most effective form of assistance given its understanding of a task. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the value of different human assistance mechanisms based on the action uncertainty of a robot policy. Our key idea is to construct mathematical expressions for the expected post-interaction differential entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of a stochastic robot policy to compare the expected value of different interactions. As each type of human input imposes a different requirement for human involvement, we demonstrate how differential entropy estimates can be combined with a likelihood penalization approach to effectively balance feedback informational needs with the level of required input. We demonstrate evidence of how our approach interfaces with emergent learning models (e.g., a diffusion model) to produce accurate assistance value estimates through both simulation and a robot user study. Our user study results indicate that the proposed approach can enable task completion with minimal human feedback for uncertain robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

While these systems also facilitate music creation, the element of human creativity and deliberate expression is often limited. In contrast, the present work allows composers, arrangers, and performers to create the basic building blocks for music creation: audio of individual musical notes for use in electronic instruments and DAWs. Through text prompts, the user can specify the timbre characteristics of the audio. We introduce a system that combines a latent diffusion model and multi-modal contrastive learning to generate musical timbres conditioned on text descriptions. By jointly generating the magnitude and phase of the spectrogram, our method eliminates the need for subsequently running a phase retrieval algorithm, as related methods do.

Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We introduce Fidelity-preserving Latent Watermarking (FLW) to generate latent watermarks based on image characteristics and the Adversarial Watermarking Modulation module to prevent "jailbreaking" via personalized finetuning. To enhance U-Net's efficiency in learning watermark patterns with limited samples, we propose Efficient Concept Watermark Finetuning, which alternates optimization of model parameters for both watermark embedding and concept learning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle two key challenges in recent prominent works: i) determining which specific counterfactual features are crucial for distinguishing the "concept" of the target class from the original class, and ii) supplying valuable explanations for the non-robust classifier without relying on the support of an adversarially robust model. Our method identifies the essential region for modification through algorithms that provide visual explanations, and then our framework generates realistic counterfactual explanations by combining adversarial attacks based on pruning the adversarial gradient of the target classifier and the latent diffusion model. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on various evaluation criteria on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ datasets. In general, our method can be applied to arbitrary classifiers, highlight the strong association between visual and counterfactual explanations, make semantically meaningful changes from the target classifier, and provide observers with subtle counterfactual images.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that synthesize texture maps, we propose to generate segment-wise procedural material graphs as the appearance representation, which supports high-quality rendering and provides substantial flexibility in editing. Instead of relying on extensive paired data, i.e., 3D meshes with material graphs and corresponding text descriptions, to train a material graph generative model, we propose to leverage the pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a bridge to connect the text and material graphs. Specifically, our approach decomposes a shape into a set of segments and designs a segment-controlled diffusion model to synthesize 2D images that are aligned with mesh parts. Based on generated images, we initialize parameters of material graphs and fine-tune them through the differentiable rendering module to produce materials in accordance with the textual description. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in photorealism, resolution, and editability over existing methods.

The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While the theoretical guarantees for continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis of the discrete-state counterparts remains under-explored. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under reasonable assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in the dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent noise contained in observed behaviors easily leads to suboptimal recommendation performance. Recently, the diffusion model's ability to generate information from noise presents a promising solution to this issue, prompting us to explore its application in multimedia recommendation. Nonetheless, several challenges must be addressed: 1) The diffusion model requires simplification to meet the efficiency requirements of real-time recommender systems, 2) The generated behaviors must align with user preference. To address these challenges, we propose a Light Diffusion model for Multimedia Recommendation (LD4MRec). LD4MRec largely reduces computational complexity by employing a forward-free inference strategy, which directly predicts future behaviors from observed noisy behaviors. Meanwhile, to ensure the alignment between generated behaviors and user preference, we propose a novel Conditional neural Network (C-Net). C-Net achieves guided generation by leveraging two key signals, collaborative signals and personalized modality preference signals, thereby improving the semantic consistency between generated behaviors and user preference. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LD4MRec.</p></details> |  |

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://video-msg.github.io; The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

| **[Neural Fidelity Calibration for Informative Sim-to-Real Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08604v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and navigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands expert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge simulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the reconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity Calibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based diffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual fidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual fidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world dynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us to sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy fine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a) we fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build sequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the diffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may degrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable hallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator calibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse robots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical contribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and real-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot navigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle on snowy surfaces.</p></details> |  |

This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these models at ultra-high resolutions faces a critical trade-off between quality and efficiency due to the computational demands of long-range attention mechanisms. To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, applying DPO to video diffusion models faces critical challenges: (1) Data inefficiency. Generating thousands of videos per DPO iteration incurs prohibitive costs; (2) Evaluation uncertainty. Human annotations suffer from subjective bias, and automated discriminators fail to detect subtle temporal artifacts like flickering or motion incoherence. To address these, we propose a discriminator-free video DPO framework that: (1) Uses original real videos as win cases and their edited versions (e.g., reversed, shuffled, or noise-corrupted clips) as lose cases; (2) Trains video diffusion models to distinguish and avoid artifacts introduced by editing. This approach eliminates the need for costly synthetic video comparisons, provides unambiguous quality signals, and enables unlimited training data expansion through simple editing operations. We theoretically prove the framework's effectiveness even when real videos and model-generated videos follow different distributions. Experiments on CogVideoX demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.14167 by other authors</p></details> |

In its basic version, it only requires knowledge of the gradient of the log-density, also called the score function. However, in deep learning, it is often easier to learn the so-called "noisy-data score function", i.e. the gradient of the log-density of noisy data, more precisely when Gaussian noise is added to the data. Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms. Unlike diffusion models, our algorithm needs to know the noisy score function for one single noise level only. We further propose a simple special case which has an interesting intuitive interpretation of iteratively adding noise the data and then attempting to remove half of that noise.</p></details> |  |

When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously, unveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes crucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant importance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and behaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics research about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical applications across various fields. However, due to variations in the structure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different fields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain, with even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest advancements in network alignment research, focusing on analyzing network alignment characteristics and progress in various domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, computational linguistics and privacy protection. It provides a detailed analysis of various methods' implementation principles, processes, and performance differences, including structure consistency-based methods, network embedding-based methods, and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods. Additionally, the methods for network alignment under different conditions, such as in attributed networks, heterogeneous networks, directed networks, and dynamic networks, are presented. Furthermore, the challenges and the open issues for future studies are also discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11134v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, The 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |

Towards recognizing social media recommender systems with missing recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11000v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media plays a crucial role in shaping society, often amplifying polarization and spreading misinformation. These effects stem from complex dynamics involving user interactions, individual traits, and recommender algorithms driving content selection. Recommender systems, which significantly shape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for intervention and regulation. However, assessing their impact is challenging due to algorithmic opacity and limited data availability. To effectively model user decision-making, it is crucial to recognize the recommender system adopted by the platform. This work introduces a method for Automatic Recommender Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based solely on network structure and observed behavior. To infer the hidden recommender, we first train a Recommender Neutral User model (RNU) using a GNN and an adapted hindsight academic network recommender, aiming to reduce reliance on the actual recommender in the data. We then generate several Recommender Hypothesis-specific Synthetic Datasets (RHSD) by combining the RNU with different known recommenders, producing ground truths for testing. Finally, we train Recommender Hypothesis-specific User models (RHU) under various hypotheses and compare each candidate with the original used to generate the RHSD. Our approach enables accurate detection of hidden recommenders and their influence on user behavior. Unlike audit-based methods, it captures system behavior directly, without ad hoc experiments that often fail to reflect real platforms. This study provides insights into how recommenders shape behavior, aiding efforts to reduce polarization and misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10925v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Larger-scale AIMD validation of our predictions; minor text updates.

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariance Matters: Empowering Social Recommendation via Graph Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10432v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation systems have shown significant promise in enhancing recommendation performance, particularly in addressing the issue of data sparsity in user behaviors. Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social influences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social recommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently noisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user preference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is crucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph invariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant Learning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences within the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based social recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates multiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to learn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk across these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social environments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more potential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL. The code is available at https://github.com/yimutianyang/SIGIR2025-SGIL.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</p></details> |  |

First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different classes of components. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 15.05% on the SpiceNetlist dataset and 12.01% on the Image2Net dataset over the existing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data will be made available on request</p></details> |
| **[Expressivity of Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs: An Information-Flow Centric Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03783v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly impacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model, designed for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with cluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service parameters. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in resource utilisation, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness compared to the baseline model, HUNTER, which employs a gated graph neural network aimed at achieving carbon neutrality in cloud computing for modern ICT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version accepted at IEEE ICDCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unbiased Federated Graph Learning: Label and Topology Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09963v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |

Identifying biomarkers for personalized treatment is crucial. While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD. We demonstrate that DomainGCN outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and show the added value of domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03692v4)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning-Driven Multi-Vessel Association: Fusing Multimodal Data for Maritime Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09197v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring maritime safety and optimizing traffic management in increasingly crowded and complex waterways require effective waterway monitoring. However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p></details> |  |

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Graph Heterogeneity and Heterophily from A Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13373v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption. The code is available at the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/H2SGNN/.</p></details> |  |

However, most HGP methods suffer not only from lack of considering global topology of the graph and focusing on the feature learning aspect, but also they do not align local and global features since graphs should inherently be analyzed in a multiscale way. LGRPool is proposed in the present paper as a HGP in the framework of expectation maximization in machine learning that aligns local and global aspects of message passing with each other using a regularizer to force the global topological information to be inline with the local message passing at different scales through the representations at different layers of HGP. Experimental results on some graph classification benchmarks show that it slightly outperforms some baselines.</p></details> | f tables, 2 figures |

It reduces the number of decision variables in a problem by solving a pricing problem. For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature. For a fixed computational budget, we improve the objective values by over 9\% for larger instances. We also analyze the performance of our CG algorithm and test the generalization of our method to different classes of instances than the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.

Traditional path-planning algorithms struggle in these scenarios, particularly when prior information is not available. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and transformer-based mechanisms for enhanced multi-agent coordination and collective task execution. Our approach leverages GNNs to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions through adaptive graph construction, enabling efficient information aggregation and decision-making under constrained communication. A transformer-based message-passing mechanism, augmented with edge-feature-enhanced attention, captures complex interaction patterns, while a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) with prioritized experience replay optimizes agent policies in partially observable environments. This integration is carefully designed to address specific requirements of multi-agent navigation, such as scalability, adaptability, and efficient task execution. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, with 90% service provisioning and 100% grid coverage (node discovery), while reducing the average steps per episode to 200, compared to 600 for benchmark methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), greedy algorithms and DQN.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely solely on numerical features of transaction records, this approach constructs heterogeneous transaction graphs. These graphs incorporate multiple node types, including users, merchants, and transactions. By leveraging graph neural networks, the model captures higher-order transaction relationships. A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning. These techniques strengthen the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The model achieves notable improvements in both accuracy and OC-ROC. Future research may explore the integration of dynamic graph neural networks and reinforcement learning.

There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 38th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2025), Kitakyushu, Japan, Jul 2025</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Equivariance: Modeling Turbulence with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07741v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a novel methodology for turbulence modeling in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which embeds the discrete rotational, reflectional and translational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations into the model architecture. In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.</p></details> | ICLR25 |
| **[Prediction of Usage Probabilities of Shopping-Mall Corridors Using Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07645v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method based on graph neural network (GNN) for prediction of probabilities of usage of shopping-mall corridors. The heterogeneous graph network of shops and corridor paths are obtained from floorplans of the malls by creating vector layers for corridors, shops and entrances. These are subsequently assimilated into nodes and edges of graphs. The prediction of the usage probability is based on the shop features, namely, the area and usage categories they fall into, and on the graph connecting these shops, corridor junctions and entrances by corridor paths. Though the presented method is applicable for training on datasets obtained from a field survey or from pedestrian-detecting sensors, the target data of the supervised deep-learning work flow in this work are obtained from a probability method. We also include a context-specific representation learning of latent features. The usage-probability prediction is made on each edge, which is a connection by a section of corridor path between the adjacent nodes representing the shops or corridor points. To create a feature for each edge, the hidden-layer feature vectors acquired in the message-passing GNN layers at the nodes of each edge are averaged and concatenated with the vector obtained by their multiplication. These edge-features are then passed to multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to make the final prediction of usage probability on each edge. The samples of synthetic learning dataset for each shopping mall are obtained by changing the shops' usage and area categories, and by subsequently feeding the graph into the probability model. When including different shopping malls in a single dataset, we also propose to consider graph-level features to inform the model with specific identifying features of each mall.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, working manuscript with partial results</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods have made significant progress in the field of Android malware detection. However, traditional detection methods based on static features struggle to identify obfuscated malicious code, while methods relying on dynamic analysis suffer from low efficiency. To address this, we propose a dynamic weighted feature selection method that analyzes the importance and stability of features, calculates scores to filter out the most robust features, and combines these selected features with the program's structural information. We then utilize graph neural networks for classification, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the detection system. We analyzed 8,664 malware samples from eight malware families and tested a total of 44,940 malware variants generated using seven obfuscation strategies. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an F1-score of 95.56% on the unobfuscated dataset and 92.28% on the obfuscated dataset, indicating that the model can effectively detect obfuscated malware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |

A core desideratum is that explanations are \textit{faithful}, \ie that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. However, a number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what is faithfulness exactly and how to achieve it. We make three key contributions. We begin by showing that \textit{existing metrics are not interchangeable} -- \ie explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can systematically ignore important properties of explanations. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, \textit{optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal}. Specifically, we prove that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. This does not apply to modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, prompting us to study the relationship between architectural choices and faithfulness. Finally, we show that \textit{faithfulness is tightly linked to out-of-distribution generalization}, in that simply ensuring that a GNN can correctly recognize the domain-invariant subgraph, as prescribed by the literature, does not guarantee that it is invariant unless this subgraph is also faithful.The code is publicly available on GitHub</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Uploading ICLR25 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to outperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may differ in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing methods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information granularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph Network (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous graphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at various granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant, non-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global information, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also introduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines multi-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node representation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying homophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |

However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions.

However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution.

| **[GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios.

| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04934v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages' main content.

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems.

Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication.

However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations.

| **[TGraphX: Tensor-Aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-Dimensional Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03953v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TGraphX presents a novel paradigm in deep learning by unifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance visual reasoning tasks. Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

| **[PerLA: Perceptive 3D Language Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19774v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

| **[Optimizing Quantum Circuits via ZX Diagrams using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03429v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is currently strongly limited by the impact of noise, in particular introduced by the application of two-qubit gates. For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Defense on the Fairness of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02757v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

| **[Graph Attention for Heterogeneous Graphs with Positional Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02938v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for modeling graph data, with attention mechanisms and transformers significantly enhancing their performance on graph-based tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

| **[MI-HGNN: Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Legged Robot Contact Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11146v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MI-HGNN) for learning-based contact perception. The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.
