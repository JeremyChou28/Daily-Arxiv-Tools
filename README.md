| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v4)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[TSA-WF: Exploring the Effectiveness of Time Series Analysis for Website Fingerprinting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14616v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Website fingerprinting (WF) is a technique that allows an eavesdropper to determine the website a target user is accessing by inspecting the metadata associated with the packets she exchanges via some encrypted tunnel, e.g., Tor. Recent WF attacks built using machine learning (and deep learning) process and summarize trace metadata during their feature extraction phases. This methodology leads to predictions that lack information about the instant at which a given website is detected within a (potentially large) network trace comprised of multiple sequential website accesses -- a setting known as \textit{multi-tab} WF. In this paper, we explore whether classical time series analysis techniques can be effective in the WF setting. Specifically, we introduce TSA-WF, a pipeline designed to closely preserve network traces' timing and direction characteristics, which enables the exploration of algorithms designed to measure time series similarity in the WF context. Our evaluation with Tor traces reveals that TSA-WF achieves a comparable accuracy to existing WF attacks in scenarios where website accesses can be easily singled-out from a given trace (i.e., the \textit{single-tab} WF setting), even when shielded by specially designed WF defenses. Finally, while TSA-WF did not outperform existing attacks in the multi-tab setting, we show how TSA-WF can help pinpoint the approximate instant at which a given website of interest is visited within a multi-tab trace.\footnote{This preprint has not undergone any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Simpler Fast Vision Transformers with a Jumbo CLS Token](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15021v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a simple enhancement of vision transformers (ViTs) to improve accuracy while maintaining throughput. Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Since there is only one Jumbo token, its cost is minimal, and because we share this FFN across layers, its parameter count is controlled. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. These gains are largest at small sizes / high speeds, e.g., ViT-nano+Jumbo outperforms ViT-nano+Registers by 13%. In fact, our Jumbo models are so efficient that they outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs, such as support for token dropping and other modalities. Accordingly, we demonstrate that Jumbo excels in these two settings via masked autoencoding and on a suite of time series benchmarks.

| **[Predicting Length of Stay in Neurological ICU Patients Using Classical Machine Learning and Neural Network Models: A Benchmark Study on MIMIC-IV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17929v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intensive care unit (ICU) is a crucial hospital department that handles life-threatening cases. Nowadays machine learning (ML) is being leveraged in healthcare ubiquitously. In recent years, management of ICU became one of the most significant parts of the hospital functionality (largely but not only due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). This study explores multiple ML approaches for predicting LOS in ICU specifically for the patients with neurological diseases based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The evaluated models include classic ML algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) and Neural Networks (LSTM, BERT and Temporal Fusion Transformer). Given that LOS prediction is often framed as a classification task, this study categorizes LOS into three groups: less than two days, less than a week, and a week or more. As the first ML-based approach targeting LOS prediction for neurological disorder patients, this study does not aim to outperform existing methods but rather to assess their effectiveness in this specific context. The findings provide insights into the applicability of ML techniques for improving ICU resource management and patient care. According to the results, Random Forest model proved to outperform others on static, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, a precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.67. While BERT model outperformed LSTM model on time-series data with an accuracy of 0.80, a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.80 and F1-score 0.80.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Domain Adaptation Benchmark for Time Series Data Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17899v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have significantly improved the ability to detect novelties in time series (TS) data. This success is attributed to their strong representation capabilities. However, due to the inherent variability in TS data, these models often struggle with generalization and robustness. To address this, a common approach is to perform Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, particularly Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), to handle domain shifts and emerging novel classes. While extensively studied in computer vision, UniDA remains underexplored for TS data. This work provides a comprehensive implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art TS backbones in a UniDA framework. We propose a reliable protocol to evaluate their robustness and generalization across different domains. The goal is to provide practitioners with a framework that can be easily extended to incorporate future advancements in UniDA and TS architectures. Our results highlight the critical influence of backbone selection in UniDA performance and enable a robustness analysis across various datasets and architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Low Rank Adaptation with Partial Parameter Sharing for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17872v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework: first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods.

| **[BLAST: Balanced Sampling Time Series Corpus for Universal Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17871v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal forecasting task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> |
| **[TransDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17847v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TransDF-88CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Linear CDEs: Maximally Expressive and Parallel-in-Time Sequence Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17761v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured Linear Controlled Differential Equations (SLiCEs) provide a unifying framework for sequence models with structured, input-dependent state-transition matrices that retain the maximal expressivity of dense matrices whilst being cheaper to compute. The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh--Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4 and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh--Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the state-of-the-art performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A tensor network approach for chaotic time series prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17740v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article may be downloaded for personal use only.

| **[TimeCF: A TimeMixer-Based Model with adaptive Convolution and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss for long-term time seris forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17532v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that by introducing prior knowledge, multi-scale analysis of complex and non-stationary time series in real environments can achieve good results in the field of long-term forecasting. However, affected by channel-independent methods, models based on multi-scale analysis may produce suboptimal prediction results due to the autocorrelation between time series labels, which in turn affects the generalization ability of the model. To address this challenge, we are inspired by the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and the recently proposed FreDF method and design a deep learning model TimeCF for long-term time series forecasting based on the TimeMixer, combined with our designed adaptive convolution information aggregation module and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss (SAMFre). Specifically, TimeCF first decomposes the original time series into sequences of different scales. Next, the same-sized convolution modules are used to adaptively aggregate information of different scales on sequences of different scales. Then, decomposing each sequence into season and trend parts and the two parts are mixed at different scales through bottom-up and top-down methods respectively. Finally, different scales are aggregated through a Feed-Forward Network. What's more, extensive experimental results on different real-world datasets show that our proposed TimeCF has excellent performance in the field of long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeCapsule: Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle of Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Compressed Predictive Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12721v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The recent increase in river-discharged nitrate poses a major risk for coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Although nitrate is an optically inactive (i.e., colourless) constituent, previous studies have demonstrated there is an indirect, non-causal relationship between water surface nitrate and water-leaving reflectance that is mediated through optically active water quality parameters such as total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter. This work aims to advance our understanding of this relationship with an effort to measure time-series nitrate and simultaneous hyperspectral reflectance at the Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia. Time-series observations revealed periodic cycles in nitrate loads due to the tidal influence in the estuarine study site. The water surface nitrate loads were predicted from hyperspectral reflectance and water salinity measurements, with hyperspectral reflectance indicating the concentrations of optically active variables and salinity indicating the mixing of river water and seawater proportions. The accuracy assessment of model-predicted nitrate against in-situ measured nitrate values showed that the predicted nitrate values correlated well with the ground-truth data, with an $R^2$ score of 0.86, and an RMSE of 0.03 mg/L. This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting water surface nitrate from hyperspectral reflectance and salinity measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IGARSS2025</p></details> |
| **[HyperIMTS: Hypergraph Neural Network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17431v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are characterized by irregular time intervals within variables and unaligned observations across variables, posing challenges in learning temporal and variable dependencies. Many existing IMTS models either require padded samples to learn separately from temporal and variable dimensions, or represent original samples via bipartite graphs or sets. However, the former approaches often need to handle extra padding values affecting efficiency and disrupting original sampling patterns, while the latter ones have limitations in capturing dependencies among unaligned observations. To represent and learn both dependencies from original observations in a unified form, we propose HyperIMTS, a Hypergraph neural network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Observed values are converted as nodes in the hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable hyperedges to enable message passing among all observations. Through irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS captures variable dependencies in a time-adaptive way to achieve accurate forecasting. Experiments demonstrate HyperIMTS's competitive performance among state-of-the-art models in IMTS forecasting with low computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, it faces fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing 863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand underestimation from 7.37% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code (https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

A common goal in analyzing time series data is to understand the underlying events that cause the observed variations. We conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer events described with natural language from time series data. We evaluate 18 LLMs on a task to match event sequences with real-valued time series data using a new benchmark we develop using sports data. Several current LLMs demonstrate promising abilities, with OpenAI's o1 performing the best but with DS-R1-distill-Qwen-32B outperforming proprietary models such as GPT-4o. From insights derived from analyzing reasoning failures, we also find clear avenues to improve performance. By applying post-training optimizations, i.e., distillation and self-improvement, we significantly enhance the performance of the Qwen2.5 1.5B, achieving results second only to o1.

| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added link to code implementation in PDF abstract</p></details> |

We introduce a versatile wavelet probabilistic module designed to extract and analyse the probabilistic features, which can seamlessly integrate with a variety of neural network architectures. This probabilistic module comprises an Adaptive Wavelet Probabilistic Feature Generator (AWPG) and a Channel Attention-based Probabilistic Temporal Convolutional Network (APTCN). Such formulation extends the application of wavelet probabilistic neural networks to deep neural networks for MTSC. The AWPG constructs an ensemble probabilistic model addressing different data scarcities and non-stationarity; it adaptively selects the optimal ones and generates probabilistic features for APTCN. The APTCN analyses the correlations of the features and forms a comprehensive feature space with existing MTSC models for classification. Here, we instantiate the proposed module to work in parallel with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Causal Fully Convolutional Network (C-FCN), demonstrating its broad applicability in time series analysis. The WPRCN is evaluated on 30 diverse MTS datasets and outperforms all the benchmark algorithms on average accuracy and rank, exhibiting pronounced strength in handling scarce data and physiological data subject to perturbations and non-stationarities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order approximation for uncertainty quantification in time series analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01108v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For time series with high temporal correlation, the empirical process converges rather slowly to its limiting distribution. Many statistics in change-point analysis, goodness-of-fit testing and uncertainty quantification admit a representation as functionals of the empirical process and therefore inherit its slow convergence. As a result, inference based on the asymptotic distribution of those quantities is significantly affected by relatively small sample sizes. We assess the quality of higher-order approximations of the empirical process by deriving the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding error terms. Based on the limiting distribution of the higher-order terms, we propose a novel approach to calculate confidence intervals for statistical quantities such as the median. In a simulation study, we compare coverage rates and lengths of these confidence intervals with those based on the asymptotic distribution of the empirical process and highlight some benefits of higher-order approximations of the empirical process.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alpha-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codebase will be made available upon publication.

| **[MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call \textit{motifs}. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN-AD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00278v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 |

In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, IJCNN 2025, accepted</p></details> |

Satellite images enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of spatio-temporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The paper includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, which highlight the potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource forecasting. It also discusses numerous perspectives to resolve current limitations and encourage future developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges.

While VI for neural SDEs is a promising avenue for uncertainty-aware reasoning in time-series, it is computationally challenging due to the iterative nature of maximizing the ELBO. In this work, we propose to decompose the control term into linear and residual non-linear components and derive an optimal control term for linear SDEs, using stochastic optimal control. Modeling the non-linear component by a neural network, we show how to efficiently train neural SDEs without sacrificing their expressive power. Since the linear part of the control term is optimal and does not need to be learned, the training is initialized at a lower cost and we observe faster convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the ESANN 2025 proceedings, European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning.

| **[CAIFormer: A Causal Informed Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16308v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles. However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded. Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAugment: Model Zoo-Guided RL for Few-Shot Time Series Augmentation and Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data. To address this, we present a pilot study on using reinforcement learning (RL) for time series data augmentation. Our method, ReAugment, tackles three critical questions: which parts of the training set should be augmented, how the augmentation should be performed, and what advantages RL brings to the process. Specifically, our approach maintains a forecasting model zoo, and by measuring prediction diversity across the models, we identify samples with higher probabilities for overfitting and use them as the anchor points for augmentation. Leveraging RL, our method adaptively transforms the overfit-prone samples into new data that not only enhances training set diversity but also directs the augmented data to target regions where the forecasting models are prone to overfitting. We validate the effectiveness of ReAugment across a wide range of base models, showing its advantages in both standard time series forecasting and few-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Domain-Oriented Time Series Inference Agents for Reasoning and Automated Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04047v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series inference requires more than point forecasting. It demands multi-step reasoning, constraint handling, domain knowledge incorporation, and domain-specific workflow assembly. Existing time series foundation models are limited to narrow tasks and lack flexibility to generalize across diverse scenarios. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) struggle with numerical precision. To address these limitations, we introduce TS-Reasoner, a Domain-Oriented Time Series Agent that integrates natural language reasoning with precise numerical execution. TS-Reasoner decomposes natural language instructions into structured workflows composed of statistical, logical, and domain-specific operators, and incorporates a self-refinement mechanism for adaptive execution. We evaluate its capabilities through two axes: basic time series understanding and complex multi-step inference, using the TimeSeriesExam benchmark and a newly constructed dataset. Experimental results show that TS-Reasoner significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs, highlighting the promise of domain-specialized agents for robust and interpretable time series reasoning.</p></details> |  |

It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model (SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture, to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.</p></details> |  |

Prior work employed physiological response metrics from wearable sensors to estimate the current human workload; however, these estimates only enable robots to respond to under- or overload conditions reactively. Current human workload prediction approaches are limited to short prediction horizons and fail to investigate variable lag horizons' impact on predictions. This letter investigates the impact of lag horizons on both univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models for human workload prediction. A key finding is that univariate predictions required longer lag horizons of 240 seconds (s), whereas multivariate workload predictions sufficed with shorter lag horizons with diminishing returns around 120s.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figures, Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</p></details> |  |

The concept of Granger causality helps analyze potential relationships between variables, thereby offering a method to determine whether one time series can predict - Granger cause - future values of another. Although successful, Granger causal methods still struggle with capturing long-range relations between variables. To this end, we leverage the recently successful Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture and propose Granger causal xLSTMs (GC-xLSTM). It first enforces sparsity between the time series components by using a novel dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection. Specifically, we adaptively improve the model and identify sparsity candidates. Our joint optimization procedure then ensures that the Granger causal relations are recovered robustly. Our experimental evaluation on six diverse datasets demonstrates the overall efficacy of our proposed GC-xLSTM model.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model. Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |

Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of $47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of $1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$ on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/ClaudiaShu/Sonnet</p></details> |

Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series.

Furthermore, by substituting failed elements with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic oscillators.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world time series often exhibit significant diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains, making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention, enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions.

| **[Robust Multi-Modal Forecasting: Integrating Static and Dynamic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15083v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in healthcare, where accurate predictions of future health trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends and properties of predicted time series using static features. In this work, we extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our approach remains predictive while preserving interpretability and robustness. This work represents a step towards developing robust, and generalized time series forecasting models. The code is available at https://github.com/jeremy-qin/TIMEVIEW</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference via Interpolation: Contrastive Representations Provably Enable Planning and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04082v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given time series data, how can we answer questions like "what will happen in the future?" and "how did we get here?" These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vivekmyers/contrastive_planning</p></details> |

In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.</p></details> |  |

While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting, anomaly detection and natural language tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Transformer Inference: Optimization Strategies for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16627v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. Our study presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving for periodic soft real-time applications on edge devices. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series data in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to interpret for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization, and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assimilative Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14825v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference (ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods, ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables. ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets. Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes the Main Text and Supporting Information in a single document. 39 pages (p. 1--2 Title, Contents and Abstract | p. 3--14 Main Text | p. 15--39 Supporting Information), 9 figures (3 in the Main Text and 6 in the Supporting Information), typeset in LaTeX.

| **[Text embedding models can be great data engineers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14802v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science applications.</p></details> |  |

Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is 4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models. Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350 million observations across 2,807 real-world time series. For both Toto and BOOM, we source observability data exclusively from Datadog's own telemetry and internal observability metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Toto achieves state-of-the-art performance on both BOOM and on established general purpose time series forecasting benchmarks. Toto's model weights, inference code, and evaluation scripts, as well as BOOM's data and evaluation code, are all available as open source under the Apache 2.0 License available at https://huggingface.co/Datadog/Toto-Open-Base-1.0 and https://github.com/DataDog/toto.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Forecasting of Boarding Patient Counts to Address ED Overcrowding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14765v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical, operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08, root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95. The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions. This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs excel at reasoning and generalization, they struggle with time-series inputs due to limited semantic context, numerical complexity, and sequence variability. To address these challenges, we construct SensorQA, a question-answering dataset of human-intuitive sensor-text pairs spanning diverse HAR scenarios. It supervises the Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where the model aligns sensor inputs with trend descriptions. Special tokens are introduced to mark channel boundaries. This alignment enables LLMs to interpret numerical patterns, channel-specific signals, and variable-length inputs--without requiring human annotation. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we adapt the model for multivariate HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that, guided by human-intuitive alignment, SensorLLM becomes an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier--generalizing across varied HAR settings and paving the way for foundation model research in time-series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSTS: A Benchmark for the Discovery of Correlation Structures in Time Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14596v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information, researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations, or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is "more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification; and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for correlation-based time series clustering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main + 32 pages total, 2 figures main + 6 figures appendix, 1 table main + 17 tables appendix, dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/idegen/csts, code available at https://github.com/isabelladegen/corrclust-validation</p></details> |

While Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models, commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared, transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our $7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data, Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation. Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript was submitted without proper consideration of institutional policies.

| **[Adaptive Estimation of the Transition Density of Controlled Markov Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14458v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the transition dynamics of controlled Markov chains is crucial in fields such as time series analysis, reinforcement learning, and system exploration. Traditional non-parametric density estimation methods often assume independent samples and require oracle knowledge of smoothness parameters like the H\"older continuity coefficient. These assumptions are unrealistic in controlled Markovian settings, especially when the controls are non-Markovian, since such parameters need to hold uniformly over all control values. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive estimator for the transition densities of controlled Markov chains that does not rely on prior knowledge of smoothness parameters or assumptions about the control sequence distribution. Our method builds upon recent advances in adaptive density estimation by selecting an estimator that minimizes a loss function {and} fitting the observed data well, using a constrained minimax criterion over a dense class of estimators. We validate the performance of our estimator through oracle risk bounds, employing both randomized and deterministic versions of the Hellinger distance as loss functions. This approach provides a robust and flexible framework for estimating transition densities in controlled Markovian systems without imposing strong assumptions.</p></details> | 59 pages, 20 main |

Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.</p></details> |  |

This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages in total, 17 figures</p></details> |

However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages (including references), 15 figures</p></details> |

While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples on widely used open datasets. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance explainability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Canonical Coherence for Nonstationary Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14253v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolving dependence between two clusters of multivariate signals is fundamental in neuroscience and other domains where sub-networks in a system interact dynamically over time. Despite the growing interest in multivariate time series analysis, existing methods for between-clusters dependence typically rely on the assumption of stationarity and lack the temporal resolution to capture transient, frequency-specific interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scale-specific wavelet canonical coherence (WaveCanCoh), a novel framework that extends canonical coherence analysis to the nonstationary setting by leveraging the multivariate locally stationary wavelet model. The proposed WaveCanCoh enables the estimation of time-varying canonical coherence between clusters, providing interpretable insight into scale-specific time-varying interactions between clusters. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that WaveCanCoh accurately recovers true coherence structures under both locally stationary and general nonstationary conditions. Application to local field potential (LFP) activity data recorded from the hippocampus reveals distinct dynamic coherence patterns between correct and incorrect memory-guided decisions, illustrating the capacity of the method to detect behaviorally relevant neural coordination. These results highlight WaveCanCoh as a flexible and principled tool for modeling complex cross-group dependencies in nonstationary multivariate systems.

However, data collection remains limited due to stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints, hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a promising solution to address both data scarcity and privacy issues. Yet, these models are often limited to short-term, unimodal signal patterns. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time series synthesis, with a focus on their ability to jointly handle multi-modality, long-range dependencies, and conditional generation-key challenges in the mHealth domain. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce a novel evaluation framework designed to measure both the intrinsic quality of synthetic data and its utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data augmentation scenarios.

While our prior work SDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM approaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns inherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical foundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we proposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called Multi-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale time series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple scales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data. Subsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling technique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the discrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM method and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale patterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in DTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress, BCI systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability, classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model, termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and 0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN, QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting methods generally fall into two main categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies. While CI overlooks important covariate relationships, CD captures all dependencies without distinction, introducing noise and reducing generalization. Recent advances in Channel Clustering (CC) aim to refine dependency modeling by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying tailored modeling techniques. However, coarse-grained clustering struggles to capture complex, time-varying interactions effectively. To address these challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a GNN-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. After constructing the graph from the input sequence, TimeFilter refines the learned spatial-temporal dependencies by filtering out irrelevant correlations while preserving the most critical ones in a patch-specific manner. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeFilter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Similarity Score Functions to Monitor and Interact with the Training and Denoising Process of a Time Series Diffusion Model applied to a Human Activity Recognition Dataset based on IMUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14739v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Time Series Forecasting with Cross-Future Behavior Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13896v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past decades witness the significant advancements in time series forecasting (TSF) across various real-world domains, including e-commerce and disease spread prediction. However, TSF is usually constrained by the uncertainty dilemma of predicting future data with limited past observations. To settle this question, we explore the use of Cross-Future Behavior (CFB) in TSF, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. We leverage CFB features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on real-world dataset. Experiments on both offline large-scale dataset and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAFT. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/CRAFTinTSF/CRAFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multivariate Long-Term History Representation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14737v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting. Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator (TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 GRD time series using Bayesian analysis for change point problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flood monitoring using satellite imagery faces significant limitations in existing methods, particularly regarding training data requirements and distinguishing temporary inundation from permanent water bodies. This paper presents a novel approach using Bayesian analysis for change point problems (BCP) applied to Sentinel-1 SAR time series data, which automatically detects temporal discontinuities in backscatter patterns. Our method processes raw SAR data directly with minimal preprocessing and operates without requiring training data or ancillary information, offering significant advantages for operational flood mapping in diverse geographical contexts. We validate our approach using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset across three distinct geographical settings (Weihui, China; Jubba, Somalia; and NovaKakhovka, Ukraine). Our BCP approach achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.76 (IoU: 0.25-0.61), significantly outperforming both Otsu's thresholding (F1: 0.03-0.12, IoU: 0.02-0.08) and Siamese convolutional neural network approaches (F1: 0.08-0.34, IoU: 0.05-0.24). Further analysis reveals exceptional performance in open areas with F1 scores of 0.47-0.81 (IoU: 0.31-0.68) and high recall (0.36-0.84), contrasted with substantially lower performance in urban areas, indicating a common challenge across current flood detection methods in complex environments. The proposed method's training-free nature enables immediate deployment to new regions without model retraining or adaptation, while its ability to differentiate flood inundation from permanent water bodies without ancillary data represents a significant methodological advancement in SAR-based flood detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Evaluation Policy Extraction for Ecological Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13794v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles. Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal patterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop interpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and combine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated and expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem modeling studies.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in surgical phase recognition technology have focused primarily on Transform-based methods, although methods that extract spatial features from individual frames using a CNN and video features from the resulting time series of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance. However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs employed for feature extraction or representation learning in surgical phase recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in surgical workflow analysis using a vision-language model (ReSW-VL). Our proposed method involves fine-tuning the image encoder of a CLIP (Convolutional Language Image Model) vision-language model using prompt learning for surgical phase recognition. The experimental results on three surgical phase recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04657v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning (ML) models in their systems. Ideally, ML models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up-to-date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource-intensive, costly, time-consuming, and model-dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity-Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent data distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent data distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent unnecessary retrainings. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on five time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the models' performance while significantly reducing maintenance time, costs, and the number of retrainings. Our model reuse approach achieves ML model performance comparable to the best baselines, while reducing the computation time and costs to 1/8th. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain their ML models' performance in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance time and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 Pa...</summary><p>46 Pages, 10 Figures, 15 Tables, 1 Algorithm, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

These systems operate in dynamic environments and face runtime uncertainties like data drift and model degradation, which affect the sustainability of MLS across multiple dimensions: technical, economical, environmental, and social. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses the technical dimension by streamlining the ML model lifecycle, it overlooks other dimensions. Furthermore, some traditional practices, such as frequent retraining, incur substantial energy and computational overhead, thus amplifying sustainability concerns. To address them, we introduce HarmonE, an architectural approach that enables self-adaptive capabilities in MLOps pipelines using the MAPE-K loop. HarmonE allows system architects to define explicit sustainability goals and adaptation thresholds at design time, and performs runtime monitoring of key metrics, such as prediction accuracy, energy consumption, and data distribution shifts, to trigger appropriate adaptation strategies. We validate our approach using a Digital Twin (DT) of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), focusing on traffic flow prediction as our primary use case. The DT employs time series ML models to simulate real-time traffic and assess various flow scenarios. Our results show that HarmonE adapts effectively to evolving conditions while maintaining accuracy and meeting sustainability goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ECSA 2025</p></details> |

Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.

| **[Bruno: Backpropagation Running Undersampled for Novel device Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17791v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning systems have focused on the development of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which provide hardware specialized for the deployment of neural networks, leading to potential gains in efficiency and performance. These systems typically feature an architecture that goes beyond the von Neumann architecture employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs. Neural networks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account the specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training algorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and synapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching non-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common approach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse models, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to model the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a training algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these physical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as stochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is then tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized synapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF) neurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks composed of LIF neurons. The results of the experiments show the potential advantage of using BRUNO to train networks with FeLIF neurons, by achieving a reduction in both time and memory for detecting spatio-temporal patterns with quantized synapses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 pages supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVL: Spike-based Vision-language Pretraining for Efficient 3D Open-world Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17674v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment (MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration (Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D classification (+6.1%), DVS action recognition (+2.1%), 3D detection (+1.1%), and 3D segmentation (+2.1%) with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, SVL enables SNNs to perform open-world 3D question answering, sometimes outperforming ANNs. To the best of our knowledge, SVL represents the first scalable, generalizable, and hardware-friendly paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, effectively bridging the gap between SNNs and ANNs in complex open-world understanding tasks.

| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |

FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing. We will keep tracing related works at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Awesome-RS-SpatioTemporal-VLMs</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics, visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 8 figures, CVPR 2025 Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[On the use of Graphs for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16685v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Earth's surface is subject to complex and dynamic processes, ranging from large-scale phenomena such as tectonic plate movements to localized changes associated with ecosystems, agriculture, or human activity. Satellite images enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis.

| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

Our three-part framework first establishes potential sequences to meet spatial constraints, using them to calculate a geometric lead path. This path then guides an asymptotically optimal sampling-based kinodynamic planner, which minimizes an STL-robustness cost to jointly satisfy spatiotemporal and kinodynamic constraints. In our experiments, we test our method with a velocity-controlled Ackerman-car model and demonstrate significant efficiency gains compared to prior art. Additionally, our method is able to generate complex path maneuvers, such as crossovers, something that previous methods had not demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Feature Fusion Framework for Dynamic Micro Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16372v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques, with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network (RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary "where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three well-recognised micro-expression datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image and Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16177v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp, achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves 65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.</p></details> |  |

However, this procedure often requires high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery, achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers' equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[RAZER: Robust Accelerated Zero-Shot 3D Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Reconstruction with Spatio-Temporal Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15373v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping and understanding complex 3D environments is fundamental to how autonomous systems perceive and interact with the physical world, requiring both precise geometric reconstruction and rich semantic comprehension. While existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval, segmentation, and object detection to reason about previously unseen objects and interpret natural language queries.

This study investigates whether embeddings from large-scale, self-supervised language and speech models can effectively reconstruct high-gamma neural activity characteristics, key indicators of cortical processing, recorded during speech production. We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto these high-gamma signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. Reconstructed neural signals are evaluated against high-gamma ground-truth activity using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that high-gamma activity can be effectively reconstructed using large language and speech model embeddings in all study participants, generating Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Interspeech2025</p></details> |
| **[VideoPASTA: 7K Preference Pairs That Matter for Video-LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14096v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to 3.8% on LongVideoBench, 4.1% on VideoMME, and 4.0% on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Adaptive Planning and Control for a Deformable Quadrotor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15010v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become essential in various applications, but conventional quadrotors face limitations in confined spaces and complex tasks. Deformable drones, which can adapt their shape in real-time, offer a promising solution to overcome these challenges, while also enhancing maneuverability and enabling novel tasks like object grasping. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous motion planning and control for deformable quadrotors. We introduce a shape-adaptive trajectory planner that incorporates deformation dynamics into path generation, using a scalable kinodynamic A* search to handle deformation parameters in complex environments. The backend spatio-temporal optimization is capable of generating optimally smooth trajectories that incorporate shape deformation. Additionally, we propose an enhanced control strategy that compensates for external forces and torque disturbances, achieving a 37.3\% reduction in trajectory tracking error compared to our previous work. Our approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in narrow-gap traversal and multi-modal deformable tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12214v6)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operation of water distribution networks simply aims at efficiently delivering consumers adequate water while maintaining safe water quality (WQ). However, this process entails a multi-scale interplay between hydraulic and WQ dynamics evolving spatio-temporally within such a complex infrastructure network. While prior research has addressed the hydraulic optimization problem and WQ regulation as decoupled or coupled, they often overlook control-theoretic guided solutions. This paper takes a novel approach by investigating the coupling between hydraulic and WQ dynamics from a control networks perspective. We propose a quality-aware control framework that embeds WQ controllability metrics into the network-level pump scheduling problem, acknowledging the direct influence of system hydraulics on WQ controller behavior. We examine the trade-offs between pump control energy cost and WQ performance across various network sizes and scenarios. Our results showcase how network topology, hydraulic constraints, and WQ metrics jointly impact optimal pump schedules and, accordingly, the achievable level of WQ regulation, offering insights into designing efficient control strategies for water infrastructure networks governed by interdependent dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[Energy-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14533v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks. However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning. In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL) algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed. Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world decision-making scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTVCrafter: 4D Motion Tokenization for Open-World Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10238v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios.

| **[Uni4D: A Unified Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Point Cloud Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04837v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud videos remains a challenging problem with two key limitations: (1) existing methods rely on explicit knowledge to learn motion, resulting in suboptimal representations; (2) prior Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) frameworks struggle to bridge the gap between low-level geometry and high-level dynamics in 4D data. In this work, we propose a novel self-disentangled MAE for learning expressive, discriminative, and transferable 4D representations. To overcome the first limitation, we learn motion by aligning high-level semantics in the latent space \textit{without any explicit knowledge}. To tackle the second, we introduce a \textit{self-disentangled learning} strategy that incorporates the latent token with the geometry token within a shared decoder, effectively disentangling low-level geometry and high-level semantics. In addition to the reconstruction objective, we employ three alignment objectives to enhance temporal understanding, including frame-level motion and video-level global information. We show that our pre-trained encoder surprisingly discriminates spatio-temporal representation without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on MSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both coarse-grained and fine-grained 4D downstream tasks. Notably, Uni4D improves action segmentation accuracy on HOI4D by $+3.8\%$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods rely on pose priors for motion control, resulting in limited motion diversity and continuity in details. To address this, we propose a framework that generates volumetric 4D sequences, where 3D shapes are animated under given conditions (text-image guidance) with dynamic evolution in shape and color across spatial and temporal dimensions, allowing for free navigation and rendering from any direction. We first use a coherent 3D shape and color modeling to encode the shape and color of each detailed 3D geometry frame into a latent space. Then we propose a matrixized 4D sequence representation allowing efficient diffusion model operation. Finally, we introduce spatio-temporal diffusion for 4D volumetric generation under given images and text prompts. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, 3DBiCar, DeformingThings4D and Objaverse datasets for several tasks demonstrate that our method effectively learns to generate high quality 3D shapes with consistent color and coherent mesh animations, improving over the current methods. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment in Modular Construction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13278v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular construction, involving off-site prefabrication and on-site assembly, offers significant advantages but presents complex coordination challenges for robotic automation. Effective task allocation is critical for leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) in these structured environments. This paper introduces the Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment (HVBTA) framework, a novel approach to optimizing collaboration between heterogeneous multi-agent construction teams. Inspired by human reasoning in task delegation, HVBTA uniquely integrates multiple voting mechanisms with the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced suitability assessment between agent capabilities and task requirements. The framework operates by assigning Capability Profiles to agents and detailed requirement lists called Task Descriptions to construction tasks, subsequently generating a quantitative Suitability Matrix. Six distinct voting methods, augmented by a pre-trained LLM, analyze this matrix to robustly identify the optimal agent for each task. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is integrated for decentralized, collision-free path planning, ensuring efficient and safe spatio-temporal coordination of the robotic team during assembly operations. HVBTA enables efficient, conflict-free assignment and coordination, facilitating potentially faster and more accurate modular assembly. Current work is evaluating HVBTA's performance across various simulated construction scenarios involving diverse robotic platforms and task complexities. While designed as a generalizable framework for any domain with clearly definable tasks and capabilities, HVBTA will be particularly effective for addressing the demanding coordination requirements of multi-agent collaborative robotics in modular construction due to the predetermined construction planning involved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Block by Block workshop at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM) model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage. In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters.

| **[Scene-Text Grounding for Text-Based Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14319v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decisionmaking and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study Grounded TextVideoQA by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scenetext recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, e.g., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset ViTXT-GQA which features 52K scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2K temporal segments related to 2K questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition. To advance the research of Grounded TextVideoQA, our dataset and code are at https://github.com/zhousheng97/ViTXT-GQA.git</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM |

While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of LLMs.</p></details> | 18 pages |

While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Does Vector Quantization Fail in Spatio-Temporal Forecasting? Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

| **[AFCL: Analytic Federated Continual Learning for Spatio-Temporal Invariance of Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12245v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12136v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is a key task in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoVer: Motion Verification for Motion Graphics Animations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13372v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. We introduce MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. We identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). We implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. We then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation. To evaluate our pipeline, we build a synthetic dataset of 5600 text prompts paired with ground truth MoVer verification programs. We find that while our LLM-based pipeline is able to automatically generate a correct motion graphics animation for 58.8% of the test prompts without any iteration, this number raises to 93.6% with up to 50 correction iterations. Our code and dataset are at https://mover-dsl.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Robust Optimization with Data-Driven Uncertainty for Enhancing Distribution System Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11627v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are placing growing strain on electric power systems, exposing the limitations of purely reactive responses and prompting the need for proactive resilience planning. However, existing approaches often rely on simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions, overlooking their critical interdependence. This paper proposes a novel tri-level optimization framework that integrates proactive infrastructure investment, adversarial modeling of spatio-temporal disruptions, and adaptive reactive response. We construct high-probability, distribution-free uncertainty sets using conformal prediction to capture complex and data-scarce outage patterns. To solve the resulting nested decision problem, we derive a bi-level reformulation via strong duality and develop a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods, achieving lower worst-case losses and more efficient resource allocation, especially under tight operational constraints and large-scale uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Physics-Informed Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Statistical Model for Fluid Thermodynamics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10919v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems are computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoFace: Emotion-Content Disentangled Speech-Driven 3D Talking Face Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11518v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of increasingly vivid 3D talking face has become a hot topic in recent years. Currently, most speech-driven works focus on lip synchronisation but neglect to effectively capture the correlations between emotions and facial motions. To address this problem, we propose a two-stream network called EmoFace, which consists of an emotion branch and a content branch. EmoFace employs a novel Mesh Attention mechanism to analyse and fuse the emotion features and content features. Particularly, a newly designed spatio-temporal graph-based convolution, SpiralConv3D, is used in Mesh Attention to learn potential temporal and spatial feature dependencies between mesh vertices. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce a new self-growing training scheme with intermediate supervision to dynamically adjust the ratio of groundtruth adopted in the 3D face animation task. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on our high-quality 3D emotional facial animation dataset, 3D-RAVDESS ($4.8863\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.9509\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), together with the public dataset VOCASET ($2.8669\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.4664\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal discovery on vector-valued variables and consistency-guided aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10476v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery (CD) aims to discover the causal graph underlying the data generation mechanism of observed variables. In many real-world applications, the observed variables are vector-valued, such as in climate science where variables are defined over a spatial grid and the task is called spatio-temporal causal discovery. We motivate CD in vector-valued variable setting while considering different possibilities for the underlying model, and highlight the pitfalls of commonly-used approaches when compared to a fully vectorized approach. Furthermore, often the vector-valued variables are high-dimensional, and aggregations of the variables, such as averages, are considered in interest of efficiency and robustness. In the absence of interventional data, testing for the soundness of aggregate variables as consistent abstractions that map a low-level to a high-level structural causal model (SCM) is hard, and recent works have illustrated the stringency of conditions required for testing consistency. In this work, we take a careful look at the task of vector-valued CD via constraint-based methods, focusing on the problem of consistency of aggregation for this task. We derive three aggregation consistency scores, based on compatibility of independence models and (partial) aggregation, that quantify different aspects of the soundness of an aggregation map for the CD problem. We present the argument that the consistency of causal abstractions must be separated from the task-dependent consistency of aggregation maps. As an actionable conclusion of our findings, we propose a wrapper Adag to optimize a chosen aggregation consistency score for aggregate-CD, to make the output of CD over aggregate variables more reliable. We supplement all our findings with experimental evaluations on synthetic non-time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatio-temporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at ICRA 2025 conference.

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

In this respect, traditional ANOVA-based studies and linear mixed effects models typically provide only limited exploration of the dynamic of the group brain activity and variability of the individual responses potentially leading to overly simplistic conclusions and/or missing more intricate patterns. In this study we propose a novel Bayesian model-based clustering method for functional data to simultaneously assess group effects and individual deviations over the most important temporal features in the data. To this aim, we develop an innovative multilevel partition prior to model the functional scores of a functional Principal Components decomposition of neuroscientific recordings; this approach returns a thorough exploration of group differences and individual deviations without compromising on the spatio-temporal nature of the data. By means of a simulation study we demonstrate that the proposed model returns correct classification in different clustering scenarios under low and high noise levels in the data. Finally we consider a case study using Electroencephalogram data recorded during an object recognition task where our approach provides new insights into the underlying brain mechanisms generating the data and their variability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added clarifications and additional comments throughout.

We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered signifi-cant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public en-gagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets-often politically or virally motivated-pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel da-taset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture that integrates spatio-temporal motion features from a 3D ResNeXt-101 backbone and static visual semantics from CLIP. The two streams are fused via an attention-based mechanism, while co-attention modules refine the visual, textual, and audio features for effective multi-modal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generali-zation capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detec-tion efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for de-tecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing meth-odologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |

Our approach introduces finite-horizon hierarchical factorization, a framework that plans one step at a time in a receding-horizon fashion. Robots first compute individual plans in parallel, and then dynamically group based on spatio-temporal conflicts and reachability. The framework accounts for conflict resolution, and for immediate execution and concurrent planning, significantly reducing response time compared to offline algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark maps demonstrate that our method achieves up to 60% reduction in time-to-first-action while consistently delivering high-quality solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art offline baselines across a range of problem sizes and planning horizons.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

Currently, materials experts mainly rely on conventional desktop-based systems using 2D visualisation techniques, which render respective analyses a time-consuming and mentally demanding challenge. MARV is a novel immersive visual analytics system, which makes analyses of such data more effective and engaging in an augmented reality setting. For this purpose, MARV includes three newly designed visualisation techniques: MDD Glyphs with a Skewness Kurtosis Mapper, Temporal Evolution Tracker, and Chrono Bins, facilitating interactive exploration and comparison of multidimensional distributions of attribute data from multiple time steps. A qualitative evaluation conducted with materials experts in a real-world case study demonstrates the benefits of the proposed visualisation techniques. This evaluation revealed that combining spatial and abstract data in an immersive environment improves their analytical capabilities and facilitates the identification of patterns, anomalies, as well as changes over time.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, most studies have focused on large scale predictions of phenology or developed methods which are not adequate to help crop modeler communities on leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinal-2 data and fusing them with high resolution climate data, using a novel framework. For this, we trained a Machine Learning (ML) LightGBM model to predict 13 phenological stages for eight major crops across Germany at 20 m scale. Observed phonologies were taken from German national phenology network (German Meteorological Service; DWD) between 2017 and 2021. We proposed a thorough feature selection analysis to find the best combination of RS and climate data to detect phenological stages. At national scale, predicted phenology resulted in a reasonable precision of R2 > 0.43 and a low Mean Absolute Error of 6 days, averaged over all phenological stages and crops. The spatio-temporal analysis of the model predictions demonstrates its transferability across different spatial and temporal context of Germany. The results indicated that combining radar sensors with climate data yields a very promising performance for a multitude of practical applications. Moreover, these improvements are expected to be useful to generate highly valuable input for crop model calibrations and evaluations, facilitate informed agricultural decisions, and contribute to sustainable food production to address the increasing global food demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[NetSight: Graph Attention Based Traffic Forecasting in Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07034v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic in today's networks is increasingly influenced by the interactions among network nodes as well as by the temporal fluctuations in the demands of the nodes. Traditional statistical prediction methods are becoming obsolete due to their inability to address the non-linear and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies present in today's network traffic. The most promising direction of research today is graph neural networks (GNNs) based prediction approaches that are naturally suited to handle graph-structured data. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art GNN approaches separate the modeling of spatial and temporal information, resulting in the loss of important information about joint dependencies. These GNN based approaches further do not model information at both local and global scales simultaneously, leaving significant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose NetSight. NetSight learns joint spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously at both global and local scales from the time-series of measurements of any given network metric collected at various nodes in a network. Using the learned information, NetSight can then accurately predict the future values of the given network metric at those nodes in the network. We propose several new concepts and techniques in the design of NetSight, such as spatio-temporal adjacency matrix and node normalization. Through extensive evaluations and comparison with prior approaches using data from two large real-world networks, we show that NetSight significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the source code and data used in the evaluation of NetSight on the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Dataset Condensation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06670v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid expansion of dataset sizes and the increasing complexity of deep learning models have significantly escalated the demand for computational resources, both for data storage and model training. Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by generating a compact synthetic dataset that retains the essential information from a large real dataset. However, existing methods often suffer from limited performance and poor data quality, particularly in the video domain. In this paper, we focus on video dataset distillation by employing a video diffusion model to generate high-quality synthetic videos. To enhance representativeness, we introduce Video Spatio-Temporal U-Net (VST-UNet), a model designed to select a diverse and informative subset of videos that effectively captures the characteristics of the original dataset. To further optimize computational efficiency, we explore a training-free clustering algorithm, Temporal-Aware Cluster-based Distillation (TAC-DT), to select representative videos without requiring additional training overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating performance improvements of up to \(10.61\%\) over the state-of-the-art. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets, establishing a new benchmark for video dataset distillation.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Enhancing Monotonic Modeling with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Awareness in Diverse Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14132v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we propose a novel pruning strategy, $\textbf{R}$eplace $\textbf{A}$ttention with $\textbf{M}$LP (RAM), that approximates the attention mechanism using only feedforward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projections, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance, so that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. RAM achieves a $62.579\%$ reduction in FLOPs for spatio-temporal models with less than $2.5\%$ performance drop, and a $42.233\%$ FLOPs reduction for LTSF models with less than $2\%$ performance drop.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges emerge when using promising images or environmental context masks to extract various factors for time-series network modeling, causing pre-processing errors or a loss of efficiency. Typically, pedestrian positions captured by onboard cameras are often distorted and do not accurately reflect their actual movements. To address these issues, GTransPDM -- a Graph-embedded Transformer with a Position Decoupling Module -- was developed for pedestrian crossing intention prediction by leveraging multi-modal features. First, a positional decoupling module was proposed to decompose pedestrian lateral motion and encode depth cues in the image view. Then, a graph-embedded Transformer was designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of human pose skeletons, integrating essential factors such as position, skeleton, and ego-vehicle motion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 92% accuracy on the PIE dataset and 87% accuracy on the JAAD dataset, with a processing speed of 0.05ms. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in comparison.</p></details> | IEEE SPL |
| **[Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |

In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally, incorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop evaluations.

| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[SCALE-Sim v3: A modular cycle-accurate systolic accelerator simulator for end-to-end system analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15377v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in AI, scientific computing, and high-performance computing (HPC) have driven the need for versatile and efficient hardware accelerators. Existing tools like SCALE-Sim v2 provide valuable cycle-accurate simulations for systolic-array-based architectures but fall short in supporting key modern features such as sparsity, multi-core scalability, and comprehensive memory analysis. To address these limitations, we present SCALE-Sim v3, a modular, cycle-accurate simulator that extends the capabilities of its predecessor. SCALE-Sim v3 introduces five significant enhancements: multi-core simulation with spatio-temporal partitioning and hierarchical memory structures, support for sparse matrix multiplications (SpMM) with layer-wise and row-wise sparsity, integration with Ramulator for detailed DRAM analysis, precise data layout modeling to minimize memory stalls, and energy and power estimation via Accelergy. These improvements enable deeper end-to-end system analysis for modern AI accelerators, accommodating a wide variety of systems and workloads and providing detailed full-system insights into latency, bandwidth, and power efficiency. A 128x128 array is 6.53x faster than a 32x32 array for ViT-base, using only latency as a metric. However, SCALE-Sim v3 finds that 32x32 is 2.86x more energy-efficient due to better utilization and lower leakage energy. For EdP, 64x64 outperforms both 128x128 and 32x32 for ViT-base. SCALE-Sim v2 shows a 21% reduction in compute cycles for six ResNet18 layers using weight-stationary (WS) dataflow compared to output-stationary (OS). However, when factoring in DRAM stalls, OS dataflow exhibits 30.1% lower execution cycles compared to WS, highlighting the critical role of detailed DRAM analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

Existing event deraining methods face trade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel point-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces a 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to preserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion module (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling and interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State Space Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and multi-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by frequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95 SR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a comprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences. Moreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities, viewpoints, and even snowy conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

Existing trackers often depend on cropped template regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors. Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV tracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 CVPR Anti-UAV Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, traffic sensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their high deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods can estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data. Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE rises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong performance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While most recent lip reading studies have been based on the ResNet architecture and have achieved significant success, they are not sufficiently suitable for efficiently capturing lip reading features due to high computational complexity in modeling spatio-temporal information. Additionally, using a complex visual model not only increases the complexity of lip reading models but also induces delays in the overall network for multi-modal studies (e.g., audio-visual speech recognition, speech enhancement, and speech separation). To overcome the limitations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, we apply the hierarchical structure and window self-attention of the Swin Transformer to lip reading. We configure a new lightweight scale of the Swin Transformer suitable for processing lip reading data and present the SwinLip visual speech encoder, which efficiently reduces computational load by integrating modified Convolution-augmented Transformer (Conformer) temporal embeddings with conventional spatial embeddings in the hierarchical structure. Through extensive experiments, we have validated that our SwinLip successfully improves the performance and inference speed of the lip reading network when applied to various backbones for word and sentence recognition, reducing computational load. In particular, our SwinLip demonstrated robust performance in both English LRW and Mandarin LRW-1000 datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Mandarin LRW-1000 dataset with less computation compared to the existing state-of-the-art model.</p></details> |  |

This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

While traditional methods simulate scene evolutions through trajectory prediction of potential instances, current works use the occupancy world model as a generative framework for describing fine-grained overall scene dynamics. However, existing methods cluster on the outdoor structured road scenes, while ignoring the exploration of forecasting 3D occupancy scene evolutions for robots in indoor scenes. In this work, we explore a new framework for learning the scene evolutions of observed fine-grained occupancy and propose an occupancy world model based on the combined spatio-temporal receptive field and guided autoregressive transformer to forecast the scene evolutions, called RoboOccWorld. We propose the Conditional Causal State Attention (CCSA), which utilizes camera poses of next state as conditions to guide the autoregressive transformer to adapt and understand the indoor robotics scenarios. In order to effectively exploit the spatio-temporal cues from historical observations, Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Aggregation (HSTA) is proposed to obtain the combined spatio-temporal receptive field based on multi-scale spatio-temporal windows. In addition, we restructure the OccWorld-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoboOccWorld outperforms state-of-the-art methods in indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking hardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep learning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the developmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D time-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The reconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking individual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their positions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories. Deep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual representation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D renderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this work, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and 3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to hours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval with compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph representation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track objects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose the queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the graph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate understanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop reasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior performances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA methods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |

| **[Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04059v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.A well-maintained MTSI paper and tool list are available at https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks. Codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Data Completeness in Time Series: Imputation Strategies for Missing Data Using Significant Periodically Correlated Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02008v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data is a pervasive issue in statistical analyses, affecting the reliability and validity of research across diverse scientific disciplines. Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[How Deep is your Guess? A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies. We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSI-Bench: Benchmarking Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12747v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

| **[Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian deep learning framework for medical time series data imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Mining of Switching Sparse Networks for Missing Value Imputation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09930v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Time Series Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

| **[BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |

Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although recurrent network imputation achieved the SOTA, existing models do not scale to deep architectures that can potentially alleviate issues arising in complex data. Moreover, imputation carries the risk of biased estimations of the ground truth. Yet, confidence in the imputed values is always unmeasured or computed post hoc from model output. We propose DEep Attention Recurrent Imputation (DEARI), which jointly estimates missing values and their associated uncertainty in heterogeneous multivariate time series. By jointly representing feature-wise correlations and temporal dynamics, we adopt a self attention mechanism, along with an effective residual component, to achieve a deep recurrent neural network with good imputation performance and stable convergence. We also leverage self-supervised metric learning to boost performance by optimizing sample similarity. Finally, we transform DEARI into a Bayesian neural network through a novel Bayesian marginalization strategy to produce stochastic DEARI, which outperforms its deterministic equivalent. Experiments show that DEARI surpasses the SOTA in diverse imputation tasks using real-world datasets, namely air quality control, healthcare and traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024.Code: https://github.com/17000cyh/IMDiffusion.git</p></details> |

However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\"odinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data.

Although recent transformer and diffusion model based approaches have achieved significant performance gains compared with conventional statistic based methods, spatial time series imputation still remains as a challenging issue due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and the noise uncertainty of the spatial time series data. Especially, recent diffusion process based models may introduce random noise to the imputations, and thus cause negative impact on the model performance. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive noise scaling diffusion model named SaSDim to more effectively perform spatial time series imputation. Specially, we propose a new loss function that can scale the noise to the similar intensity, and propose the across spatial-temporal global convolution module to more effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets verify the effectiveness of SaSDim by comparison with current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Acquisition of crop conditions via Sentinel-2 remote sensing images can be hindered by persistent clouds, affecting yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery, and the ratio between its cross- and co-polarized channels (C-band) shows a high correlation with time series LAI over winter wheat regions. This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues.</p></details> |  |

A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.

Whilst traditional imputation methods often impose strong assumptions on the underlying data generation process, limiting their applicability, researchers have recently begun to investigate the potential of deep learning for this task, inspired by the strong performance shown by these models in both classification and regression problems across a range of applications. In this work we propose MADS, a novel auto-decoding framework for time series imputation, built upon implicit neural representations. Our method leverages the capabilities of SIRENs for high fidelity reconstruction of signals and irregular data, and combines it with a hypernetwork architecture which allows us to generalise by learning a prior over the space of time series. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series imputation. On the human activity dataset, it improves imputation performance by at least 40%, while on the air quality dataset it is shown to be competitive across all metrics. When evaluated on synthetic data, our model results in the best average rank across different dataset configurations over all baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inc. refs), 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Networked Time Series Imputation via Position-aware Graph Enhanced Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18612v2)** | 2023-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2023 |

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework based on the principles of recurrent neural networks and neural stochastic differential equations for reconciling irregularly sampled measurements. We impute measurements at any arbitrary timescale and quantify the uncertainty in the imputations in a principled manner. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantifying and propagating the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across time instants. Our experiments on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution system reveal that our framework can outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification approaches for time-series data imputations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we focus on time series data and put forward SSSD, an imputation model that relies on two emerging technologies, (conditional) diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative models and structured state space models as internal model architecture, which are particularly suited to capture long-term dependencies in time series data.

| **[Time-Series Imputation with Wasserstein Interpolation for Optimal Look-Ahead-Bias and Variance Tradeoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12736v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing time-series data is a prevalent practical problem. Imputation methods in time-series data often are applied to the full panel data with the purpose of training a model for a downstream out-of-sample task. For example, in finance, imputation of missing returns may be applied prior to training a portfolio optimization model. Unfortunately, this practice may result in a look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the training data. By connecting layers of information revealed in time, we propose a Bayesian posterior consensus distribution which optimally controls the variance and look-ahead-bias trade-off in the imputation. We demonstrate the benefit of our methodology both in synthetic and real financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been superseded by arXiv:2202.00871</p></details> |

Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.</p></details> |  |

The imputation aims to fill the missing values with valid values. Most imputation methods trained the models implicitly because missing values have no ground truth. In this paper, we propose Random Drop Imputation with Self-training (RDIS), a novel training method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete data. We can explicitly train the imputation models by filling in the randomly dropped values. In addition, we adopt self-training with pseudo values to exploit the original missing values. To improve the quality of pseudo values, we set the threshold and filter them by calculating the entropy. To verify the effectiveness of RDIS on the time series imputation, we test RDIS to various imputation models and achieve competitive results on two real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDI: Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03502v2)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines.

| **[Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI</p></details> |

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Imputation and Prediction with Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08900v1)** | 2020-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)</p></details> |
| **[CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09904v2)** | 2019-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications involve multivariate, geo-tagged time series data: at each location, multiple sensors record corresponding measurements. For example, air quality monitoring system records PM2.5, CO, etc. The resulting time-series data often has missing values due to device outages or communication errors. In order to impute the missing values, state-of-the-art methods are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which process each time stamp sequentially, prohibiting the direct modeling of the relationship between distant time stamps. Recently, the self-attention mechanism has been proposed for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, significantly outperforming RNN because the relationship between each two time stamps can be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism for multivariate, geo-tagged time series data. In order to jointly capture the self-attention across multiple dimensions, including time, location and the sensor measurements, while maintain low computational complexity, we propose a novel approach called Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including three standard benchmarks and our newly collected NYC-traffic dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation and forecasting methods. A detailed systematic analysis confirms the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.</p></details> |  |

| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19341v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |

Existing works typically assume regularly sampled, well-structured data, limiting their applicability to more generalized scenarios where time series often contain missing values, unequal sequence lengths, and irregular time intervals between measurements. To cover diverse domains and handle variable regularities, we propose FlexTSF, a universal time series forecasting model that possesses better generalization and natively support both regular and irregular time series. FlexTSF produces forecasts in an autoregressive manner and incorporates three novel designs: VT-Norm, a normalization strategy to ablate data domain barriers, IVP Patcher, a patching module to learn representations from flexibly structured time series, and LED attention, an attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these two and propagate forecasts with awareness of domain and time information. Experiments on 12 datasets show that FlexTSF outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models respectively designed for regular and irregular time series. Furthermore, after self-supervised pre-training, FlexTSF shows exceptional performance in both zero-shot and few-show settings for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08732v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |

Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.</p></details> |  |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue.

| **[ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10635v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

| **[Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting asynchronous bioprocess timeseries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02079v2)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cultivation experiments often produce sparse and irregular time series. Classical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood fitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity and time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools are not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular approaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation) and interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods transfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target model. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of the input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for imputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular nature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online monitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we focus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for typical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on several forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models under realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting procedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Precursor-of-Anomaly Detection for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15489v3)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is an important field that aims to identify unexpected patterns or data points, and it is closely related to many real-world problems, particularly to applications in finance, manufacturing, cyber security, and so on. While anomaly detection has been studied extensively in various fields, detecting future anomalies before they occur remains an unexplored territory. In this paper, we present a novel type of anomaly detection, called Precursor-of-Anomaly (PoA) detection. Unlike conventional anomaly detection, which focuses on determining whether a given time series observation is an anomaly or not, PoA detection aims to detect future anomalies before they happen. To solve both problems at the same time, we present a neural controlled differential equation-based neural network and its multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments using 17 baselines and 3 datasets, including regular and irregular time series, and demonstrate that our presented method outperforms the baselines in almost all cases. Our ablation studies also indicate that the multitasking training method significantly enhances the overall performance for both anomaly and PoA detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Deep Efficient Continuous Manifold Learning for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03379v2)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling non-Euclidean data is drawing extensive attention along with the unprecedented successes of deep neural networks in diverse fields. Particularly, a symmetric positive definite matrix is being actively studied in computer vision, signal processing, and medical image analysis, due to its ability to learn beneficial statistical representations. However, owing to its rigid constraints, it remains challenging to optimization problems and inefficient computational costs, especially, when incorporating it with a deep learning framework. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit a diffeomorphism mapping between Riemannian manifolds and a Cholesky space, by which it becomes feasible not only to efficiently solve optimization problems but also to greatly reduce computation costs. Further, for dynamic modeling of time-series data, we devise a continuous manifold learning method by systematically integrating a manifold ordinary differential equation and a gated recurrent neural network. It is worth noting that due to the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky space, training our proposed network equipped with Riemannian geometric metrics is straightforward. We demonstrate through experiments over regular and irregular time-series datasets that our proposed model can be efficiently and reliably trained and outperforms existing manifold methods and state-of-the-art methods in various time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUTS+: High-dimensional Causal Discovery from Irregular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05890v2)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series is a fundamental problem in the machine learning community, enabling causal reasoning and decision-making in complex scenarios. Recently, researchers successfully discover causality by combining neural networks with Granger causality, but their performances degrade largely when encountering high-dimensional data because of the highly redundant network design and huge causal graphs. Moreover, the missing entries in the observations further hamper the causal structural learning. To overcome these limitations, We propose CUTS+, which is built on the Granger-causality-based causal discovery method CUTS and raises the scalability by introducing a technique called Coarse-to-fine-discovery (C2FD) and leveraging a message-passing-based graph neural network (MPGNN). Compared to previous methods on simulated, quasi-real, and real datasets, we show that CUTS+ largely improves the causal discovery performance on high-dimensional data with different types of irregular sampling.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI-24 |
| **[Time-Parameterized Convolutional Neural Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03210v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Time Evidential Distributions for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13503v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent in many real-world settings such as healthcare, irregular time series are challenging to formulate predictions from. It is difficult to infer the value of a feature at any given time when observations are sporadic, as it could take on a range of values depending on when it was last observed. To characterize this uncertainty we present EDICT, a strategy that learns an evidential distribution over irregular time series in continuous time. This distribution enables well-calibrated and flexible inference of partially observed features at any time of interest, while expanding uncertainty temporally for sparse, irregular observations. We demonstrate that EDICT attains competitive performance on challenging time series classification tasks and enabling uncertainty-guided inference when encountering noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare.

| **[Warpformer: A Multi-scale Modeling Approach for Irregular Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09368v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in various fields, particularly in healthcare, and exhibit two key characteristics: intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | KDD23 Research Track |
| **[Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12156v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/issaz/sigker-nsdes/</p></details> |
| **[Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07031v2)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins.</p></details> |  |

NODEs were designed to tackle the irregular time series problem. However, NODEs have demonstrated robustness against various noises and adversarial attacks. This paper is about the natural robustness of NODEs and examines the cause behind such surprising behaviour. We show that by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the ODE dynamics the robustness can be significantly improved. We derive our approach from Grownwall's inequality. Further, we draw parallels between contractivity theory and Grownwall's inequality. Experimentally we corroborate the enhanced robustness on numerous datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR 100. We also present the impact of adaptive and non-adaptive solvers on the robustness of NODEs.</p></details> | Final project paper |

Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02320v1)** | 2023-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real-world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real-world time series can include large-scale, irregular, and intermittent time series observations, raising significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz-constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=UG8bQcD3Emv</p></details> |
| **[Finding Short Signals in Long Irregular Time Series with Continuous-Time Attention Policy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04052v1)** | 2023-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly-sampled time series (ITS) are native to high-impact domains like healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals. However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real data, we find that CAT outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods by finding short signals in long irregular time series.</p></details> |  |

In comparison with similar models, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), the key distinctive characteristics of NCDEs are i) the adoption of the continuous path created by an interpolation algorithm from each raw discrete time-series sample and ii) the adoption of the Riemann--Stieltjes integral. It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method. We design an encoder-decoder module based on NCDEs and NODEs, and a special training method for it. Our method shows the best performance in both time-series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures; presented in IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI-2022)</p></details> |

Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.</p></details> | main 8 pages |

Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).</p></details> |  |

Early warning systems in hospitals, for example, let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution, Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem.

Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2022, Baltimore, Maryland</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an improvement in the runtime on ODE-RNNs by using a different efficient batching strategy. Our experiments show that the new models reduce the runtime of ODE-RNN significantly ranging from 2 times up to 49 times depending on the irregularity of the data while maintaining comparable accuracy. Hence, our model can scale favorably for modeling larger irregular data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although the increasing amount of data enables pattern identification and therefore prediction, carrying this task manually is hardly feasible. We hereby propose a cased-based reasoning approach for automatic prediction of rare events on strategic sites. This method allows direct incorporation of expert knowledge, and is adapted to irregular time series and small-size datasets. Experiments are carried out on two use-cases using real satellite images: the prediction of submarines arrivals and departures from a naval base, and the forecasting of imminent rocket launches on two space bases. The proposed method significantly outperforms a random selection of reference cases on these challenging applications, showing its strong potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p></details> |
| **[Imputing Missing Observations with Time Sliced Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05634v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet novel time series imputation technique with the goal of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of non-overlapping bins (dubbed "slices") of observation times and ensure that each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoFITS: Automatic Feature Engineering for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14806v1)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time. Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency (e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown encouraging performance in identifying genes that are predictive for cancer survival, but are still limited in modeling the distribution over genes. Here, we proposed a novel method that can simulate the gene expression distribution at any given time point, including those that are out of the range of the observed time points. In order to model the irregular time series where each patient is one observation, we integrated a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) with cox regression into our framework. We evaluated our method on eight cancer types on TCGA and observed a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Our visualization results and further analysis indicate how our method can be used to simulate expression at the early cancer stage, offering the possibility for early cancer identification.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDM 2021, Corrected typos</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Continuous Stochastic Processes with Dynamic Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10516v4)** | 2021-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution and have proved to be powerful models for data generation and density estimation. In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Online Prediction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11028v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) are a continuous-time extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance at modelling functions of irregular time series. In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08295v4)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks, and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2021</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Convolutions: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Raw Seismic Data Ingestion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13631v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional seismic processing workflows (SPW) are expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction (gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI: Set Embedding based SDI approach. SESDI first breaks down the mammoth task of large-scale prediction into an efficient compact auxiliary task. SESDI gracefully incorporates irregularities in data with its novel model architecture. We believe SESDI is the first successful demonstration of end-to-end learning on real seismic data. SESDI achieves SSIM of over 0.8 on velocity inversion task on real proprietary data from the Gulf of Mexico and outperforms the state-of-the-art U-Net model on synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Integration Learning for Irregularly-sampled Clinical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09986v2)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) data is sparse and irregular as it is recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926v2)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Model for Demand and Supply Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12469v1)** | 2020-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for demand forecasting only focus on modeling the temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Path Imputation Strategies for Signature Models of Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12359v2)** | 2020-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature transform is a 'universal nonlinearity' on the space of continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies, Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general, while improving robustness of signature models in particular.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalised Interpretable Shapelets for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13948v2)** | 2020-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shapelet transform is a form of feature extraction for time series, in which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of `shapelets'. However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification.</p></details> |  |

Although the algorithm detects the arm with the highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in information and communications technology.</p></details> |  |

| **[Discrete-time autoregressive model for unequally spaced time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11158v1)** | 2019-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00125v1)** | 2019-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Clustering Invariance in Irregular Healthcare Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12206v1)** | 2019-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic records contain sequences of events, some of which take place all at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits, each with a different timestamp. We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53% to 53.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference of Misaligned Irregular Time Series with Application to Greenland Ice Core Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3014v3)** | 2014-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ice cores provide insight into the past climate over many millennia. Due to ice compaction, the raw data for any single core are irregular in time. Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are misaligned. After processing, such data are made available to researchers as regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient. Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process model can be widely extended as the models used can be viewed within the larger context of continuous space-time processes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly with autoregressive models due to the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. Autoregressive models typically rely on image tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction, whereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce computational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably lose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation quality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the most human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection of text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and diversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the recognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature similarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces reconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB memory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze the reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at smaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video, conducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an effective complement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark, homepagee: https://wjf5203.github.io/TokBench</p></details> |

| **[Towards more transferable adversarial attack in black-box manner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18097v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition, reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> |
| **[Strictly Constrained Generative Modeling via Split Augmented Langevin Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18017v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models hold great promise for representing complex physical systems, but their deployment is currently limited by the lack of guarantees on the physical plausibility of the generated outputs. Ensuring that known physical constraints are enforced is therefore critical when applying generative models to scientific and engineering problems. We address this limitation by developing a principled framework for sampling from a target distribution while rigorously satisfying physical constraints. Leveraging the variational formulation of Langevin dynamics, we propose Split Augmented Langevin (SAL), a novel primal-dual sampling algorithm that enforces constraints progressively through variable splitting, with convergence guarantees. While the method is developed theoretically for Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate its effective applicability to diffusion models. In particular, we use constrained diffusion models to generate physical fields satisfying energy and mass conservation laws. We apply our method to diffusion-based data assimilation on a complex physical system, where enforcing physical constraints substantially improves both forecast accuracy and the preservation of critical conserved quantities. We also demonstrate the potential of SAL for challenging feasibility problems in optimal control.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts, which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases, resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts, and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set grounded segmentation task in the field.</p></details> |  |

While discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD 1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks. Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity, particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand compositionality, but conditions apply!

A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

| **[Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.</p></details> |  |

With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Papers</p></details> |
| **[From Score Matching to Diffusion: A Fine-Grained Error Analysis in the Gaussian Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11615v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from an unknown distribution, accessible only through discrete samples, is a fundamental problem at the core of generative AI. The current state-of-the-art methods follow a two-step process: first, estimating the score function (the gradient of a smoothed log-distribution) and then applying a diffusion-based sampling algorithm -- such as Langevin or Diffusion models. The resulting distribution's correctness can be impacted by four major factors: the generalization and optimization errors in score matching, and the discretization and minimal noise amplitude in the diffusion. In this paper, we make the sampling error explicit when using a diffusion sampler in the Gaussian setting. We provide a sharp analysis of the Wasserstein sampling error that arises from these four error sources. This allows us to rigorously track how the anisotropy of the data distribution (encoded by its power spectrum) interacts with key parameters of the end-to-end sampling method, including the number of initial samples, the stepsizes in both score matching and diffusion, and the noise amplitude. Notably, we show that the Wasserstein sampling error can be expressed as a kernel-type norm of the data power spectrum, where the specific kernel depends on the method parameters. This result provides a foundation for further analysis of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing sampling accuracy.</p></details> | 59 pages |

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |
| **[Generative Data Augmentation for Object Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17783v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08278v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 2025 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC) as an oral presentation and has been nominated for the best paper award</p></details> |

In this work, we revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://dongzhang89.github.io/RGenie.github.io/</p></details> |

However, little attention has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels, as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels. Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool for part-aware 3D shape editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffBreak: Is Diffusion-Based Purification Robust?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, attributing it to two critical flaws: incorrect gradients and inappropriate evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that with proper accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient flaws that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</p></details> | 36 pages, 15 figures |

However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps.

While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

| **[Deeper Diffusion Models Amplify Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17560v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs), their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'', revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

However, their ability to produce explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods.

We show that the set of noisy samples, taken across all noise levels simultaneously, forms a statistical manifold -- a family of denoising probability distributions. Interpreting the noise level as a temporal parameter, we refer to this manifold as spacetime. This manifold naturally carries a Fisher-Rao metric, which defines geodesics -- shortest paths between noisy points. Notably, this family of distributions is exponential, enabling efficient geodesic computation even in high-dimensional settings without retraining or fine-tuning. We demonstrate the practical value of this geometric viewpoint in transition path sampling, where spacetime geodesics define smooth sequences of Boltzmann distributions, enabling the generation of continuous trajectories between low-energy metastable states.

Compared to state-of-the-art strategies, our approach improves reconstruction accuracy by 52.9\%, reduces hallucinated peaks by 55.6%, and requires 60% less time in complex NMR experiments. This advancement holds promise for many applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where rapid and high-resolution spectral analysis is critical.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Dataset and code can be found in https://flytweety.github.io/AnimeDL2M/.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+2 p...</summary><p>8+2 pages; update figure 3,4,5 as adding real images into detection task tests</p></details> |
| **[Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 18 figures |

The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion with Enhanced Dimensional Correlations Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17384v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

However, they still exhibit a significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a \textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint. To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.</p></details> |  |

Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This thesis proposal investigates methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward modeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches. We classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated, binary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient, reward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency and safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how they improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss inter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier ones. Based on the survey, we identify five promising research directions for the next two years: (1) multi-objective alignment with combined rewards, (2) efficient human feedback usage and active learning, (3) robust safety alignment against adversarial inputs, (4) continual and online alignment of diffusion models, and (5) interpretable and trustworthy reward modeling for generative images. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges, related work, and a proposed research plan. The proposal is organized as a comprehensive document with literature review, comparative tables of methods, and detailed research plans, aiming to contribute new insights and techniques for safer and value-aligned diffusion-based generative AI.</p></details> |  |

FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Differential Fields for 4D Motion Modeling via Image-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17333v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos. Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>early...</summary><p>early accepted by MICCAI</p></details> |

On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC (e.g. MBOP) and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.</p></details> | Published at TMLR |

Existing methods often require training additional modules to handle specific controls such as identity, attributes, or age, making them inflexible and resource-intensive. We propose ExpertGen, a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained expert models such as face recognition, facial attribute recognition, and age estimation networks to guide generation with fine control. Our approach uses a latent consistency model to ensure realistic and in-distribution predictions at each diffusion step, enabling accurate guidance signals to effectively steer the diffusion process. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that expert models can guide the generation process with high precision, and multiple experts can collaborate to enable simultaneous control over diverse facial aspects. By allowing direct integration of off-the-shelf expert models, our method transforms any such model into a plug-and-play component for controllable face generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18865v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures; accepted by ICML'25</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding the Benefits of Neural Network Parameterizations in Geophysical Inversions: A Study With Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17503v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we employ neural fields, which use neural networks to map a coordinate to the corresponding physical property value at that coordinate, in a test-time learning manner. For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training dataset. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Statistical Significance in Diffusion-Based Anomaly Localization via Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11789v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly localization in images (identifying regions that deviate from expected patterns) is vital in applications such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. A recent trend is the use of image generation models in anomaly localization, where these models generate normal-looking counterparts of anomalous images, thereby allowing flexible and adaptive anomaly localization. However, these methods inherit the uncertainty and bias implicitly embedded in the employed generative model, raising concerns about the reliability. To address this, we propose a statistical framework based on selective inference to quantify the significance of detected anomalous regions. Our method provides $p$-values to assess the false positive detection rates, providing a principled measure of reliability. As a proof of concept, we consider anomaly localization using a diffusion model and its applications to medical diagnoses and industrial inspections. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively controls the risk of false positive detection, supporting its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures |
| **[When Are Concepts Erased From Diffusion Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17013v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nyu-dice-lab.github.io/when-are-concepts-erased/</p></details> |

This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

| **[Pursuing Temporal-Consistent Video Virtual Try-On via Dynamic Pose Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16980v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.

Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images (e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more creative regional details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 2025</p></details> |

Here, we investigate how self-attention query (Q) features simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method - implemented with VideoCrafter2 and WAN 2.1 - that is 10 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(1) P...</summary><p>(1) Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/MotionByQueries/ (2) The methods and results in section 5, "Consistent multi-shot video generation", are based on the arXiv version 1 (v1) of this work.

| **[Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16959v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e., memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models, generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs. memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized. We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical guarantees for denoising reflected diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01563v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, denoising diffusion models have become a crucial area of research due to their abundance in the rapidly expanding field of generative AI. While recent statistical advances have delivered explanations for the generation ability of idealised denoising diffusion models for high-dimensional target data, implementations introduce thresholding procedures for the generating process to overcome issues arising from the unbounded state space of such models. This mismatch between theoretical design and implementation of diffusion models has been addressed empirically by using a \emph{reflected} diffusion process as the driver of noise instead. In this paper, we study statistical guarantees of these denoising reflected diffusion models. In particular, we establish minimax optimal rates of convergence in total variation, up to a polylogarithmic factor, under Sobolev smoothness assumptions. Our main contributions include the statistical analysis of this novel class of denoising reflected diffusion models and a refined score approximation method in both time and space, leveraging spectral decomposition and rigorous neural network analysis.</p></details> |  |

Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

We observe that the absence of a standardized evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3) catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Efficient Video Generation via Dynamic Token Carving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16864v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges: the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1) early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds -- without requiring model retraining.

| **[Conditional Panoramic Image Generation via Masked Autoregressive Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16862v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing promising scalability and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations. EduVisBench and EduVisAgent are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisBench and https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisAgent.</p></details> | 16 pages; 7 figures |

In this paper, we present Make-An-Agent, a novel policy parameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation. Guided by behavior embeddings that encode trajectory information, our policy generator synthesizes latent parameter representations, which can then be decoded into policy networks. Trained on policy network checkpoints and their corresponding trajectories, our generation model demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and has a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed policies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs. We showcase its efficacy and efficiency on various domains and tasks, including varying objectives, behaviors, and even across different robot manipulators. Beyond simulation, we directly deploy policies generated by Make-An-Agent onto real-world robots on locomotion tasks.

We propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively, via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while retaining performance on conventional scenarios.

| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Prior work takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in VAEs by showing diagonal posterior covariance matrices promote orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. Building on this, we close the gap in our understanding of disentanglement by showing how if follows from such orthogonality and equates to factoring the data distribution into statistically independent components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forward-only Diffusion Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16733v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned (e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative modelling.

| **[Masked Conditioning for Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16725v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally. computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Sampling Through The Reuse Of Attention Maps In Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01008v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for flexible and realistic image synthesis. Nevertheless, these models rely on a time-consuming sampling procedure, which has motivated attempts to reduce their latency. When improving efficiency, researchers often use the original diffusion model to train an additional network designed specifically for fast image generation. In contrast, our approach seeks to reduce latency directly, without any retraining, fine-tuning, or knowledge distillation. In particular, we find the repeated calculation of attention maps to be costly yet redundant, and instead suggest reusing them during sampling. Our specific reuse strategies are based on ODE theory, which implies that the later a map is reused, the smaller the distortion in the final image. We empirically compare our reuse strategies with few-step sampling procedures of comparable latency, finding that reuse generates images that are closer to those produced by the original high-latency diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Variational Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06281v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing interest in diffusion models, gaining a deep understanding of the model class remains an elusive endeavour, particularly for the uninitiated in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Thanks to the rapid rate of progress in the field, most existing work on diffusion models focuses on either applications or theoretical contributions. Unfortunately, the theoretical material is often inaccessible to practitioners and new researchers, leading to a risk of superficial understanding in ongoing research. Given that diffusion models are now an indispensable tool, a clear and consolidating perspective on the model class is needed to properly contextualize recent advances in generative modelling and lower the barrier to entry for new researchers. To that end, we revisit predecessors to diffusion models like hierarchical latent variable models and synthesize a holistic perspective using only directed graphical modelling and variational inference principles. The resulting narrative is easier to follow as it imposes fewer prerequisites on the average reader relative to the view from non-equilibrium thermodynamics or stochastic differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Coordinate- and Dimension-Agnostic Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16549v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in. This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate- and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call ``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Relational Database Generation via Graph-Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16527v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets. However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Face Swapping: A Diffusion-Based Digital Human Benchmark for Multimodal Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16512v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo, etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in designing conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to their unique structural characteristics. Meanwhile, the scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits the progress, making this important area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model, and then generating their orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble them into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently outperforms existing conformation generation methods, thus facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Consistent World Models via Foresight Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16474v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-based models have enabled significant progress in generation tasks across various modalities and have recently found applications in world modeling. However, unlike typical generation tasks that encourage sample diversity, world models entail different sources of uncertainty and require consistent samples aligned with the ground-truth trajectory, which is a limitation we empirically observe in diffusion models. We argue that a key bottleneck in learning consistent diffusion-based world models lies in the suboptimal predictive ability, which we attribute to the entanglement of condition understanding and target denoising within shared architectures and co-training schemes. To address this, we propose Foresight Diffusion (ForeDiff), a diffusion-based world modeling framework that enhances consistency by decoupling condition understanding from target denoising. ForeDiff incorporates a separate deterministic predictive stream to process conditioning inputs independently of the denoising stream, and further leverages a pretrained predictor to extract informative representations that guide generation. Extensive experiments on robot video prediction and scientific spatiotemporal forecasting show that ForeDiff improves both predictive accuracy and sample consistency over strong baselines, offering a promising direction for diffusion-based world models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing video generation models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image, enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Style Transfer with Diffusion Models for Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16360v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

However, for different types of atomic systems -- such as molecules and materials -- the generative processes are usually highly specific to the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We introduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion framework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic molecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified, all-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent embedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent embeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or materials. Experiments on MP20, QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets demonstrate that jointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as materials, obtaining state-of-the-art results on par with molecule and crystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers with minimal inductive biases for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant speedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion models. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves performance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation models for generative chemistry.

VAR predicts a set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models. However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU baseline, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A theoretical and empirical study around SMOTE and its variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03819v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a common rebalancing strategy for handling imbalanced tabular data sets. However, few works analyze SMOTE theoretically. In this paper, we derive several non-asymptotic upper bound on SMOTE density. From these results, we prove that SMOTE (with default parameter) tends to copy the original minority samples asymptotically. We confirm and illustrate empirically this first theoretical behavior on a real-world data-set.bFurthermore, we prove that SMOTE density vanishes near the boundary of the support of the minority class distribution. We then adapt SMOTE based on our theoretical findings to introduce two new variants. These strategies are compared on 13 tabular data sets with 10 state-of-the-art rebalancing procedures, including deep generative and diffusion models. One of our key findings is that, for most data sets, applying no rebalancing strategy is competitive in terms of predictive performances, would it be with LightGBM, tuned random forests or logistic regression. However, when the imbalance ratio is artificially augmented, one of our two modifications of SMOTE leads to promising predictive performances compared to SMOTE and other state-of-the-art strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately modeling user preferences remains challenging due to the noise perturbations inherent in the forward and reverse processes of diffusion-based methods. Towards this end, this study introduces FMRec, a Flow Matching based model that employs a straight flow trajectory and a modified loss tailored for the recommendation task. Additionally, from the diffusion-model perspective, we integrate a reconstruction loss to improve robustness against noise perturbations, thereby retaining user preferences during the forward process. In the reverse process, we employ a deterministic reverse sampler, specifically an ODE-based updating function, to eliminate unnecessary randomness, thereby ensuring that the generated recommendations closely align with user needs. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets reveal that FMRec achieves an average improvement of 6.53% over state-of-the-art methods.

However, the dozens of sampling steps they require, make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR.

Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, published to IFIP International Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management</p></details> |

Rethinking Concept Erasure Through Reversibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16174v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods, Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of concepts from generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Dr. C...</summary><p>Dr. Chi Zhang is the corresponding author</p></details> |
| **[TRAIL: Transferable Robust Adversarial Images via Latent diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16166v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks exploiting unrestricted natural perturbations present severe security risks to deep learning systems, yet their transferability across models remains limited due to distribution mismatches between generated adversarial features and real-world data. While recent works utilize pre-trained diffusion models as adversarial priors, they still encounter challenges due to the distribution shift between the distribution of ideal adversarial samples and the natural image distribution learned by the diffusion model. To address the challenge, we propose Transferable Robust Adversarial Images via Latent Diffusion (TRAIL), a test-time adaptation framework that enables the model to generate images from a distribution of images with adversarial features and closely resembles the target images. To mitigate the distribution shift, during attacks, TRAIL updates the diffusion U-Net's weights by combining adversarial objectives (to mislead victim models) and perceptual constraints (to preserve image realism). The adapted model then generates adversarial samples through iterative noise injection and denoising guided by these objectives. Experiments demonstrate that TRAIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-model attack transferability, validating that distribution-aligned adversarial feature synthesis is critical for practical black-box attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remasking Discrete Diffusion Models with Inference-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00307v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with a blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://remdm.github.io</p></details> |
| **[OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16091v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Split Gibbs Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01161v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of posterior sampling in discrete-state spaces using discrete diffusion models. While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a principled plug-and-play discrete diffusion posterior sampling algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling, which we call SGDD. Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate the convergence of SGDD to the target posterior distribution and verify this through controlled experiments on synthetic benchmarks. Our method enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, including DNA sequence design, discrete image inverse problems, and music infilling, achieving more than 30% improved performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Our evaluation shows that SAeUron outperforms existing approaches on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for concepts and style unlearning, and effectively eliminates nudity when evaluated with I2P. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content under adversarial attack. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cywinski/SAeUron.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our method treats identity and text as a unified conditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). Compared to prior methods, FaceCLIP-SDXL enables photorealistic portrait generation with better identity preservation and textual relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its quantitative and qualitative superiority.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy. In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging the Powerful Attention of a Pre-trained Diffusion Model for Exemplar-based Image Colorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15812v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model, making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization guidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred and non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of colorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference. Specifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research, achieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to the reference).

Existing approaches either build on methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise control of the camera and body poses.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.</p></details> | Under review |

In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICIP 2025</p></details> |

However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First Author and Second Author contributed equally to this work.

However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image. Furthermore, by integrating a texture generation module and a human motion generation module, we produce customized physics-plausible and realistic dynamic garment demonstrations.

In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18088v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs. Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |

Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks, outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We will make the code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM (Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced feature representations throughout the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SpectralGap: Graph-Level Out-of-Distribution Detection via Laplacian Eigenvalue Gaps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15177v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps (the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right) \mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional training or model modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision for Zero-Shot Inference on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17599v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, two major limitations severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b) impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility. To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 AI4Tech Track</p></details> |

Analyzing functional brain networks through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding mental disorder behaviors. Although existing fMRI-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in brain network feature extraction, they often fail to characterize complex relationships between brain regions and demographic information in mental disorders. To overcome these limitations, we propose a learnable NeuroTree framework that integrates a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and contrastive masked functional connectivity (CMFC) to enhance similarities and dissimilarities of brain region distance. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets. It provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns, elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models, face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for slide-level classification.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

A Comparative Study of VAE-GNN vs. ViT-MLP and VAE-MLP Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17363v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the exponential rise in IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various advanced techniques for both dimensionality reduction and attack detection to enhance IoT security. Among these, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), have garnered significant research attention in the domain of attack detection. This study evaluates the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for IoT botnet detection: a VAE encoder with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a VAE encoder with a GCN, a VAE encoder with a GAT, and a ViT encoder with an MLP. The evaluation is conducted on a widely studied IoT benchmark dataset--the N-BaIoT dataset for both binary and multiclass tasks. For the binary classification task, all models achieved over 99.93% in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with no notable differences in performance. In contrast, for the multiclass classification task, GNN-based models showed significantly lower performance compared to VAE-MLP and ViT-MLP, with accuracies of 86.42%, 89.46%, 99.72%, and 98.38% for VAE-GCN, VAE-GAT, VAE-MLP, and ViT-MLP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Attention Neural Network for Botnet Detection: Evaluating Autoencoder, VAE and PCA-Based Dimension Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17357v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs, leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Free Graph Data Selection under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17293v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem. Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call \textit{motifs}. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |

However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization.

However, existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions. Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods that have access to labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we integrate structural insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks, including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.</p></details> |  |

These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backward Oversmoothing: why is it hard to train deep Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16736v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice, which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view. In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing. Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.

| **[FairSIN: Achieving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks through Sensitive Information Neutralization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12474v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling graph-structured data, like other machine learning models, GNNs are also susceptible to making biased predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. For fairness consideration, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods propose to filter out sensitive information from inputs or representations, e.g., edge dropping or feature masking. However, we argue that such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature information, leading to a sub-optimal trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To address this issue, we unveil an innovative neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) are incorporated into node features or representations before message passing. The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional nonsensitive information. We also provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (neighbors with different sensitive attributes). We name our method as FairSIN, and present three implementation variants from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets with three different GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining high prediction accuracies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Joint Relational Database Generation via Graph-Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16527v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets. However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically, we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction confidence and recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\% classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025 February Cycle</p></details> |

The system is modeled as a graph structure. Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used. Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions, including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02454v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable confidence estimation is essential for enhancing the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes scenarios. Despite its importance, accurately estimating confidence in LLM responses remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose using an auxiliary learning model to assess response correctness based on the self-consistency of multiple outputs generated by the LLM. Our method builds a consistency graph to represent the agreement among multiple responses and uses a graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the likelihood that each response is correct. Experiments demonstrate that this method has strong calibration performance on various benchmark datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Algorithm Feedback: One-Shot SAT Solver Guidance with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16053v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science, yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17464v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphons are continuous models that represent the structure of graphs and allow the generation of graphs of varying sizes. We propose Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs. Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Structure Boosts Link Prediction on Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15746v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network, which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions. Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Conditional Flow Matching for Relational Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15668v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main content, submitted to a conference</p></details> |
| **[SCENIR: Visual Semantic Clarity through Unsupervised Scene Graph Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15867v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |

Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2025 (KDD 2025). 14 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in embedding methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising improvements. However, these methods often lack a thorough analysis of their expressiveness and suffer from effective benchmarks for a fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to assess the expressiveness of existing methods, highlighting the impact of dual embeddings and decoder design on directed link prediction performance. To address limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a robust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and modular extensibility. The results on DirLinkBench show that current methods struggle to achieve strong performance, while DiGAE outperforms other baselines overall. We further revisit DiGAE theoretically, showing its graph convolution aligns with GCN on an undirected bipartite graph. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel Spectral Directed Graph Auto-Encoder SDGAE that achieves state-of-the-art average performance on DirLinkBench. Finally, we analyze key factors influencing directed link prediction and highlight open challenges in this field.</p></details> | Preprint |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance. To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs) were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 7th International Workshop on PRedictive Intelligence in MEdicine (Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2024)</p></details> |

To efficiently model large-scale systems, existing methods mainly employ hierarchical graph structures to capture multi-scale node relations. However, these graph hierarchies are typically manually designed and fixed, limiting their ability to adapt to the evolving dynamics of complex physical systems. We propose EvoMesh, a fully differentiable framework that jointly learns graph hierarchies and physical dynamics, adaptively guided by physical inputs. EvoMesh introduces anisotropic message passing, which enables direction-specific aggregation of dynamic features between nodes within each hierarchy, while simultaneously learning node selection probabilities for the next hierarchical level based on physical context. This design creates more flexible message shortcuts and enhances the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on five benchmark physical simulation datasets show that EvoMesh outperforms recent fixed-hierarchy message passing networks by large margins.

We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node, MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive directions determined by the target node's own representation. These projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks. Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate graph discrimination.</p></details> |  |

While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark different FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/FedGraph/fedgraph</p></details> |

Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing in the nonlinear setting without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.</p></details> |  |

| **[Topology-aware Detection and Localization of Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks in Network-on-Chips](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14898v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables on-chip communication between diverse cores in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. With its shared communication fabric, NoC has become a focal point for various security threats, especially in heterogeneous and high-performance computing platforms. Among these attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks occur when multiple malicious entities collaborate to overwhelm and disrupt access to critical system components, potentially causing severe performance degradation or complete disruption of services. These attacks are particularly challenging to detect due to their distributed nature and dynamic traffic patterns in NoC, which often evade static detection rules or simple profiling. This paper presents a framework to conduct topology-aware detection and localization of DDoS attacks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by analyzing NoC traffic patterns. Specifically, by modeling the NoC as a graph, our method utilizes spatiotemporal traffic features to effectively identify and localize DDoS attacks. Unlike prior works that rely on handcrafted features or threshold-based detection, our GNN-based approach operates directly on raw inter-flit delay data, learning complex traffic dependencies without manual intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect and localize DDoS attacks with high accuracy (up to 99\%) while maintaining consistent performance under diverse attack strategies. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits strong robustness across varying numbers and placements of malicious IPs, different packet injection rates, application workloads, and architectural configurations, including both 2D mesh and 3D TSV-based NoCs. Our work provides a scalable, flexible, and architecture-agnostic defense mechanism, significantly improving the availability and trustworthiness of on-chip communication in future SoC designs.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a) adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in various settings. \footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}{github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Adverseness vs. Equilibrium: Exploring Graph Adversarial Resilience through Dynamic Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14463v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system. Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.</p></details> |  |

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference. Our code and datasets are available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CDCL-NLI-637E/}{CDCL-NLI-link} for peer review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Distributed Control of Multi-Robot Systems with Communication Delays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09382v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe operation of multi-robot systems is critical, especially in communication-degraded environments such as underwater for seabed mapping, underground caves for navigation, and in extraterrestrial missions for assembly and construction. We address safety of networked autonomous systems where the information exchanged between robots incurs communication delays. We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.

| **[Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14748v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE. However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships, which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by CoCa-sampling.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

| **[Unsupervised Graph Clustering with Deep Structural Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14040v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) provides key insights for graph-based clustering, yet current methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and contrastive learning often rely heavily on the original graph structure. Their performance deteriorates when the original graph's adjacency matrix is too sparse or contains noisy edges unrelated to clustering. Moreover, these methods depend on learning node embeddings and using traditional techniques like k-means to form clusters, which may not fully capture the underlying graph structure between nodes. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DeSE, a novel unsupervised graph clustering framework incorporating Deep Structural Entropy. It enhances the original graph with quantified structural information and deep neural networks to form clusters. Specifically, we first propose a method for calculating structural entropy with soft assignment, which quantifies structure in a differentiable form. Next, we design a Structural Learning layer (SLL) to generate an attributed graph from the original feature data, serving as a target to enhance and optimize the original structural graph, thereby mitigating the issue of sparse connections between graph nodes. Finally, our clustering assignment method (ASS), based on GNNs, learns node embeddings and a soft assignment matrix to cluster on the enhanced graph. The ASS layer can be stacked to meet downstream task requirements, minimizing structural entropy for stable clustering and maximizing node consistency with edge-based cross-entropy loss. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets against eight representative unsupervised graph clustering baselines, demonstrating the superiority of the DeSE in both effectiveness and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2025 (KDD 2025). 13 pages, 10 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Scope Experts at Test: Generalizing Deeper Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multivariate Long-Term History Representation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14737v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting. Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator (TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Maximum Independent Sets in Dynamic Graphs using Unsupervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13754v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art MaxIS methods for static graphs, including a mixed integer programming solver, deterministic rule-based algorithms, and a heuristic learning framework based on dynamic programming and GNNs. Across synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs of 100-10,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic learning framework in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. Our model generalizes well on graphs 100x larger than the ones used for training, achieving performance at par with both a greedy technique and a commercial mixed integer programming solver while running 1.5-23x faster than greedy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 tables |
| **[Implicit vs Unfolded Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06592v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been observed that message-passing graph neural networks (GNN) sometimes struggle to maintain a healthy balance between the efficient/scalable modeling of long-range dependencies across nodes while avoiding unintended consequences such oversmoothed node representations, sensitivity to spurious edges, or inadequate model interpretability. To address these and other issues, two separate strategies have recently been proposed, namely implicit and unfolded GNNs (that we abbreviate to IGNN and UGNN respectively). The former treats node representations as the fixed points of a deep equilibrium model that can efficiently facilitate arbitrary implicit propagation across the graph with a fixed memory footprint. In contrast, the latter involves treating graph propagation as unfolded descent iterations as applied to some graph-regularized energy function. While motivated differently, in this paper we carefully quantify explicit situations where the solutions they produce are equivalent and others where their properties sharply diverge. This includes the analysis of convergence, representational capacity, and interpretability. In support of this analysis, we also provide empirical head-to-head comparisons across multiple synthetic and public real-world node classification benchmarks. These results indicate that while IGNN is substantially more memory-efficient, UGNN models support unique, integrated graph attention mechanisms and propagation rules that can achieve strong node classification accuracy across disparate regimes such as adversarially-perturbed graphs, graphs with heterophily, and graphs involving long-range dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this work has been accepted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[TopoTune : A Framework for Generalized Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06530v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in learning from relational datasets as they preserve the symmetries of the graph domain. However, many complex systems -- such as biological or social networks -- involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the GNN ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software for defining, building, and training GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cayley Graph Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03424v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the plethora of success stories with graph neural networks (GNNs) on modelling graph-structured data, they are notoriously vulnerable to over-squashing, whereby tasks necessitate the mixing of information between distance pairs of nodes. To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself to discovering and precomputing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate over-squashing. One well regarded family of bottleneck-free graphs within the mathematical community are expander graphs, with prior work -- Expander Graph Propagation (EGP) -- proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family -- the Cayley graphs of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ special linear group -- as a computational template for GNNs. However, in EGP the computational graphs used are truncated to align with a given input graph. In this work, we show that truncation is detrimental to the coveted expansion properties. Instead, we propose CGP, a method to propagate information over a complete Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only shows that CGP recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but it is also akin to or outperforms computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Third Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2024), PMLR 269. 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits.

We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training, where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Filtering Meets Spectrum Shift: Connecting User-Item Interaction with Graph-Structured Side Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08071v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in collaborative filtering, where the user-item (U-I) interaction bipartite graph serves as the fundamental data format. However, when graph-structured side information (e.g., multimodal similarity graphs or social networks) is integrated into the U-I bipartite graph, existing graph collaborative filtering methods fall short of achieving satisfactory performance. We quantitatively analyze this problem from a spectral perspective. Recall that a bipartite graph possesses a full spectrum within the range of [-1, 1], with the highest frequency exactly achievable at -1 and the lowest frequency at 1; however, we observe as more side information is incorporated, the highest frequency of the augmented adjacency matrix progressively shifts rightward. This spectrum shift phenomenon has caused previous approaches built for the full spectrum [-1, 1] to assign mismatched importance to different frequencies. To this end, we propose Spectrum Shift Correction (dubbed SSC), incorporating shifting and scaling factors to enable spectral GNNs to adapt to the shifted spectrum. Unlike previous paradigms of leveraging side information, which necessitate tailored designs for diverse data types, SSC directly connects traditional graph collaborative filtering with any graph-structured side information. Experiments on social and multimodal recommendation demonstrate the effectiveness of SSC, achieving relative improvements of up to 23% without incurring any additional computational overhead.

Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.

| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Power Allocation for Delay Optimization in Device-to-Device Networks: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12902v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations. This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides competitive results compared to the state of the art while being computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the trained network.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often use graph neural networks to model dialogue context, capturing structural dynamics but heavily relying on annotated graph structures and overlooking individual speaking styles. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation framework. CMR employs a two-stage self-supervised contrastive learning framework. First, it captures global differences in speaking styles across individuals. Then, it focuses on intra-conversation comparisons to identify thematic transitions and contextually relevant facts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that applies contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CMR not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also generalizes well to large pre-trained language models, effectively enhancing their capability in handling multi-party conversations.</p></details> |  |

Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with \textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to \textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node classification accuracy on real-world datasets.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Graph Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12614v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and unlearning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous detection methods have been developed to differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts (HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap. Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation, we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing the Scarcity of Benchmarks for Graph XAI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12437v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both 15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000 additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[It Takes a Graph to Know a Graph: Rewiring for Homophily with a Reference Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12411v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Graphon Neural Networks: Approximation and Cut Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14338v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains achievable.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

| **[GraphFLEx: Structure Learning Framework for Large Expanding Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12323v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph structure learning is a core problem in graph-based machine learning, essential for uncovering latent relationships and ensuring model interpretability. However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx: a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12304v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities. Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of PPCS.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different component classes. Experimental results achieve accuracy improvements of 16.08% on SpiceNetlist, 11.38% on Image2Net, and 16.01% on Masala-CHAI in intra-dataset evaluation, while maintaining accuracy from 92.05% to 99.07% in cross-dataset evaluation, exhibiting robust feature transfer capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data will be made available on request.

| **[Enhancing Knowledge Graph Completion with GNN Distillation and Probabilistic Interaction Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12272v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as fundamental structures for organizing interconnected data across diverse domains. However, most KGs remain incomplete, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to address this issue by inferring missing links, but existing methods face critical challenges: deep graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing, while embedding-based models fail to capture abstract relational features. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a unified framework that integrates GNN distillation and abstract probabilistic interaction modeling (APIM). GNN distillation approach introduces an iterative message-feature filtering process to mitigate over-smoothing, preserving the discriminative power of node representations. APIM module complements this by learning structured, abstract interaction patterns through probabilistic signatures and transition matrices, allowing for a richer, more flexible representation of entity and relation interactions. We apply these methods to GNN-based models and the APIM to embedding-based KGC models, conducting extensive evaluations on the widely used WN18RR and FB15K-237 datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The findings highlight the importance of both controlling information propagation and leveraging structured probabilistic modeling, offering new avenues for advancing knowledge graph completion.

To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and multimodal reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yiwei-Ou/MMS-VPR.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |

Such frequent updates pose significant challenges for inferencing over Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current approaches that perform vertex-wise and layer-wise inferencing are impractical for dynamic graphs as they cause redundant computations, expand to large neighborhoods, and incur high communication costs for distributed setups, resulting in slow update propagation that often exceeds real-time latency requirements. This motivates the need for streaming GNN inference frameworks that are efficient and accurate over large, dynamic graphs. We propose Ripple, a framework that performs fast incremental updates of embeddings arising due to updates to the graph topology or vertex features. Ripple provides a generalized incremental programming model, leveraging the properties of the underlying aggregation functions employed by GNNs to efficiently propagate updates to the affected neighborhood and compute the exact new embeddings. Besides a single-machine design, we also extend this execution model to distributed inferencing, to support large graphs that do not fit in a single machine's memory. Ripple on a single machine achieves up to $\approx28000$ updates/sec for sparse graphs like Arxiv and $\approx1200$ updates/sec for larger and denser graphs like Products, with latencies of $0.1$ms--$1$s that are required for near-realtime applications. The distributed version of Ripple offers up to $\approx30\times$ better throughput over the baselines, due to $70\times$ lower communication costs during updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper to appear in the proceedings of the 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)</p></details> |
| **[Relation-Aware Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12027v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens. In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11930v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs, and various homophily metrics have been designed to help recognize these challenging datasets. Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics: 1) lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient evaluation on the truly challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs. To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, and categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets. We identify malignant and ambiguous heterophily as the truly challenging subsets of tasks, and to our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy. Then, we re-evaluate $11$ state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs, covering six popular methods, with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets. Based on the model performance, we comprehensively reassess the effectiveness of different methods on heterophily. At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different graph generation approaches. To overcome the unreliability of observation-based comparison and evaluation, we conduct the first quantitative evaluation and provide detailed analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.09618</p></details> |

However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

This phenomena has been attributed in part to oversmoothing, the tendency of node representations to become increasingly similar with network depth. In this paper we introduce an analogy between oversmoothing in GNNs and consensus (i.e., perfect agreement) in the opinion dynamics literature. We show that the message passing algorithms of several GNN models are equivalent to linear opinion dynamics models which have been shown to converge to consensus for all inputs regardless of the graph structure. This new perspective on oversmoothing motivates the use of nonlinear opinion dynamics as an inductive bias in GNN models. In our Behavior-Inspired Message Passing (BIMP) GNN, we leverage the nonlinear opinion dynamics model which is more general than the linear opinion dynamics model, and can be designed to converge to dissensus for general inputs. Through extensive experiments we show that BIMP resists oversmoothing beyond 100 time steps and consistently outperforms existing architectures even when those architectures are amended with oversmoothing mitigation techniques. We also show that BIMP has several desirable properties including well behaved gradients and adaptability to homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |

However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
